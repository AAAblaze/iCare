       "  'symptoms': \"Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early signs include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations. As the disease progresses, memory impairments worsen and other symptoms develop. At first, a person with Alzheimer's disease may be aware of having difficulty remembering things and organizing thoughts. A family member or friend may be more likely to notice how the symptoms worsen. Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease lead to growing trouble with: Memory Everyone has occasional memory lapses, but the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease persists and worsens, affecting the ability to function at work or at home. People with Alzheimer's may: Repeat statements and questions over and over Forget conversations, appointments or events, and not remember them later Routinely misplace possessions, often putting them in illogical locations Get lost in familiar places Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects Have trouble finding the right words to identify objects, express thoughts or take part in conversations Thinking and reasoning Alzheimer's disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Multitasking is especially difficult, and it may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually, a person with Alzheimer's may be unable to recognize and deal with numbers. Making judgments and decisions Alzheimer's causes a decline in the ability to make reasonable decisions and judgments in everyday situations. For example, a person may make poor or uncharacteristic choices in social interactions or wear clothes that are inappropriate for the weather. It may be more difficult to respond effectively to everyday problems, such as food burning on the stove or unexpected driving situations. Planning and performing familiar tasks Once-routine activities that require sequential steps, such as planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game, become a struggle as the disease progresses. Eventually, people with advanced Alzheimer's often forget how to perform basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Changes in personality and behavior Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Problems may include the following: Depression Apathy Social withdrawal Mood swings Distrust in others Irritability and aggressiveness Changes in sleeping habits Wandering Loss of inhibitions Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen Preserved skills Many important skills are preserved for longer periods even while symptoms worsen. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories and reminiscing, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts. These skills may be preserved longer because they are controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease. When to see a doctor A number of conditions, including treatable conditions, can result in memory loss or other dementia symptoms. If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your doctor for a thorough assessment and diagnosis. If you are concerned about thinking skills you observe in a family member or friend, talk about your concerns and ask about going together to a doctor's appointment.

       "  'symptoms': 'Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include: Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain Anxiety, agitation or restlessness Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why. Depression symptoms in children and teens Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences. In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight. In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction. Depression symptoms in older adults Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as: Memory difficulties or personality changes Physical aches or pain Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex — not caused by a medical condition or medication Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men When to see a doctor If you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can. If you\\'re reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. When to get emergency help If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Also consider these options if you\\'re having suicidal thoughts: Call your doctor or mental health professional. Call a suicide hotline number — in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). Use that same number and press \"1\" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line. Reach out to a close friend or loved one. Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.

Blood often backs up and causes fluid to build up in the lungs (congest) and in the legs. The fluid buildup can cause shortness of breath and swelling of the legs and feet. Poor blood flow may cause the skin to appear blue (cyanotic). Some types of heart failure can lead to an enlarged heart. Heart failure can be ongoing (chronic), or it may start suddenly (acute). Heart failure signs and symptoms may include: Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down Fatigue and weakness Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet Rapid or irregular heartbeat Reduced ability to exercise Persistent cough or wheezing with white or pink blood-tinged mucus Swelling of the belly area (abdomen) Very rapid weight gain from fluid buildup Nausea and lack of appetite Difficulty concentrating or decreased alertness Chest pain if heart failure is caused by a heart attack When to see a doctor See your doctor if you think you might be experiencing signs or symptoms of heart failure. Call 911 or emergency medical help if you have any of the following: Chest pain Fainting or severe weakness Rapid or irregular heartbeat associated with shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting Sudden, severe shortness of breath and coughing up white or pink, foamy mucus Although these signs and symptoms may be due to heart failure, there are many other possible causes, including other life-threatening heart and lung conditions. Don't try to diagnose yourself. Emergency room doctors will try to stabilize your condition and determine if your symptoms are due to heart failure or something else. If you have a diagnosis of heart failure and if any of the symptoms suddenly become worse or you develop a new sign or symptom, it may mean that existing heart failure is getting worse or not responding to treatment. This may also be the case if you gain 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) or more within a few days. Contact your doctor promptly.

Symptoms of heart disease in your blood vessels A buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries, or atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis) can damage your blood vessels and heart. Plaque buildup causes narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other signs and symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue. Signs and symptoms can include: Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina) Shortness of breath Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for cardiovascular symptoms and discuss concerns with your doctor. Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular evaluations. Heart disease symptoms caused by abnormal heartbeats (heart arrhythmias) Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia signs and symptoms can include: Fluttering in your chest Racing heartbeat (tachycardia) Slow heartbeat (bradycardia) Chest pain or discomfort Shortness of breath Lightheadedness Dizziness Fainting (syncope) or near fainting Heart disease symptoms caused by heart defects Serious heart defects that you're born with (congenital heart defects) usually are noticed soon after birth. Heart defect signs and symptoms in children could include: Pale gray or blue skin color (cyanosis) Swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around the eyes In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain Less serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include: Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity Easily tiring during exercise or activity Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet Heart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) In early stages of cardiomyopathy, you may have no symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include: Breathlessness with activity or at rest Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet Fatigue Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting Heart disease symptoms caused by heart infection Endocarditis is an infection that affects the inner lining of your heart chambers and heart valves (endocardium). Heart infection signs and symptoms can include: Fever Shortness of breath Weakness or fatigue Swelling in your legs or abdomen Changes in your heart rhythm Dry or persistent cough Skin rashes or unusual spots Heart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems (valvular heart disease) The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves — that open and close to direct blood flow through your heart. Many things can damage your heart valves, leading to narrowing (stenosis), leaking (regurgitation or insufficiency) or improper closing (prolapse). Depending on which valve isn't working properly, valvular heart disease signs and symptoms generally include: Fatigue Shortness of breath Irregular heartbeat Swollen feet or ankles Chest pain Fainting (syncope) When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease signs and symptoms: Chest pain Shortness of breath Fainting Always call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack. Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early, so talk to your doctor about your concerns regarding your heart health. If you're concerned about developing heart disease, talk to your doctor about steps you can take to reduce your heart disease risk.

A few people with high blood pressure may have headaches, shortness of breath or nosebleeds, but these signs and symptoms aren't specific and usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage. When to see a doctor You'll likely have your blood pressure taken as part of a routine doctor's appointment. Ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18. If you're age 40 or older, or you're 18 to 39 with a high risk of high blood pressure, ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading every year. Blood pressure generally should be checked in both arms to determine if there's a difference. It's important to use an appropriate-sized arm cuff. Your doctor will likely recommend more-frequent readings if you've already been diagnosed with high blood pressure or have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Children age 3 and older will usually have blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups. If you don't regularly see your doctor, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community. You can also find machines in some stores that will measure your blood pressure for free. Public blood pressure machines, such as those found in pharmacies, may provide helpful information about your blood pressure, but they may have some limitations. The accuracy of these machines depends on several factors, such as a correct cuff size and proper use of the machines. Ask your doctor for advice on using public blood pressure machines.

Data has shown that the <abbr title=\"coronavirus disease 2019\">COVID-19</abbr> virus spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.</p>\n",
       "<p>Sometimes the <abbr title=\"coronavirus disease 2019\">COVID-19</abbr> virus can spread when a person is exposed to very small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours — called airborne transmission.</p>\n",

These include the delta (B.1.617.2) variant and the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. The delta variant is more contagious than earlier variants and might cause more severe disease.

       "{'Symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. You can still spread COVID-19 before you have symptoms (presymptomatic transmission). Common signs and symptoms can include: Fever Cough Tiredness Early symptoms of COVID-19 may include a loss of taste or smell. Other symptoms can include: Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Muscle aches Chills Sore throat Runny nose Headache Chest pain Pink eye (conjunctivitis) Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Rash This list isn't complete. Children have similar symptoms to adults and generally have mild illness. The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have only a few symptoms. Some people may have no symptoms at all, but can still spread it (asymptomatic transmission). Some people may experience worsened symptoms, such as worsened shortness of breath and pneumonia, about a week after symptoms start. Some people experience COVID-19 symptoms for more than four weeks after they're diagnosed. These health issues are sometimes called post- COVID-19 conditions. Some children experience multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a syndrome that can affect some organs and tissues, several weeks after having COVID-19. Rarely, some adults experience the syndrome too. People who are older have a higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, and the risk increases with age. People who have existing medical conditions also may have a higher risk of serious illness. Certain medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious illness from COVID-19 include: Serious heart diseases, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy Cancer Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Type 1 or type 2 diabetes Overweight, obesity or severe obesity High blood pressure Smoking Chronic kidney disease Sickle cell disease or thalassemia Weakened immune system from solid organ transplants or bone marrow transplants Pregnancy Asthma Chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension Liver disease Dementia Down syndrome Weakened immune system from bone marrow transplant, HIV or some medications Brain and nervous system conditions, such as strokes Substance use disorders This list is not complete. Other medical conditions may increase your risk of serious illness from COVID-19. COVID-19 self-checker Assess your symptoms on CDC’s coronavirus self-checker tool and find out if you’re a candidate for a COVID-19 test. When to see a doctor If you have COVID-19 signs or symptoms or you've been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, contact your health care provider right away for medical advice. Your health care provider will likely recommend that you get tested for COVID-19. If you have emergency COVID-19 symptoms, such as trouble breathing, seek care immediately. If you need to go to a hospital, call ahead so that health care providers can take steps to ensure that others aren't exposed. If you have emergency COVID-19 signs and symptoms, seek care immediately. Emergency signs and symptoms can include: Trouble breathing Persistent chest pain or pressure Inability to stay awake New confusion Pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds — depending on skin tone This list isn't complete. Let your health care provider know if you are an older adult or have chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease or lung disease, as you may have a greater risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19. \"}"
