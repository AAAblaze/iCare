You usually can't see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort. But straining or irritation when passing stool can cause: Painless bleeding during bowel movements. You might notice small amounts of bright red blood on your toilet tissue or in the toilet. A hemorrhoid to push through the anal opening (prolapsed or protruding hemorrhoid), resulting in pain and irritation.

Don't assume rectal bleeding is due to hemorrhoids, especially if you have changes in bowel habits or if your stools change in color or consistency.

People who have a lung disease, such as emphysema, can develop a chronic form of histoplasmosis. Signs of chronic histoplasmosis can include weight loss and a bloody cough. The symptoms of chronic histoplasmosis sometimes mimic those of tuberculosis. Severe histoplasmosis The most severe variety of histoplasmosis occurs primarily in infants and in people with compromised immune systems. Called disseminated histoplasmosis, it can affect nearly any part of your body, including your mouth, liver, central nervous system, skin and adrenal glands. If untreated, disseminated histoplasmosis is usually fatal.

It's normal to exhibit oppositional behavior at certain stages of a child's development. Signs of ODD generally begin during preschool years. Sometimes ODD may develop later, but almost always before the early teen years. These behaviors cause significant impairment with family, social activities, school and work. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, lists criteria for diagnosing ODD. The DSM-5 criteria include emotional and behavioral symptoms that last at least six months. Angry and irritable mood: Often and easily loses temper Is frequently touchy and easily annoyed by others Is often angry and resentful Argumentative and defiant behavior: Often argues with adults or people in authority Often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or rules Often deliberately annoys or upsets people Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior Vindictiveness: Is often spiteful or vindictive Has shown spiteful or vindictive behavior at least twice in the past six months ODD can vary in severity: Mild. Symptoms occur only in one setting, such as only at home, school, work or with peers. Moderate. Some symptoms occur in at least two settings. Severe. Some symptoms occur in three or more settings. For some children, symptoms may first be seen only at home, but with time extend to other settings, such as school and with friends. When to see a doctor Your child isn't likely to see his or her behavior as a problem. Instead, he or she will probably complain about unreasonable demands or blame others for problems. If your child shows signs that may indicate ODD or other disruptive behavior, or you're concerned about your ability to parent a challenging child, seek help from a child psychologist or a child psychiatrist with expertise in disruptive behavior problems.

       "  'symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms — other than short stature — vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders. Disproportionate dwarfism Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body. Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus). The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following: An average-size trunk Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers Limited mobility at the elbows A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose Progressive development of bowed legs Progressive development of swayed lower back An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm) Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include: A very short trunk A short neck Shortened arms and legs Average-size hands and feet Broad, rounded chest Slightly flattened cheekbones Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward A foot that's twisted or out of shape Instability of the neck bones Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine Progressive development of swayed lower back Vision and hearing problems Arthritis and problems with joint movement Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm) Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems. Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include: Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts Growth rate slower than expected for age Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism are often present at birth or in early infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not be immediately apparent. See your child's doctor if you have any concerns about your child's growth or overall development.

Diabetes can affect nerves in any of these areas, possibly causing: A lack of awareness that blood sugar levels are low (hypoglycemia unawareness) Bladder or bowel problems Slow stomach emptying (gastroparesis), causing nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite Changes in the way your eyes adjust from light to dark Decreased sexual response Proximal neuropathy (diabetic polyradiculopathy) This type of neuropathy — also called diabetic amyotrophy — often affects nerves in the thighs, hips, buttocks or legs. It can also affect the abdominal and chest area. Symptoms are usually on one side of the body, but may spread to the other side. You may have: Severe pain in a hip and thigh or buttock Eventual weak and shrinking thigh muscles Difficulty rising from a sitting position Severe stomach pain Mononeuropathy (focal neuropathy) There are two types of mononeuropathy — cranial and peripheral. Mononeuropathy refers to damage to a specific nerve.

       "  'symptoms': \"The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. Primary infection (Acute HIV) Some people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within two to four weeks after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat and painful mouth sores Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck Diarrhea Weight loss Cough Night sweats These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In this stage of infection, HIV is still present in the body and in white blood cells. However, many people may not have any symptoms or infections during this time. This stage can last for many years if you're not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Pneumonia Progression to AIDS Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years. When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers — diseases that wouldn't usually cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include: Sweats Chills Recurring fever Chronic diarrhea Swollen lymph glands Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth Persistent, unexplained fatigue Weakness Weight loss Skin rashes or bumps When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a doctor as soon as possible. \"},\n",

These tears drain into small openings on the inner part of your eyelids (puncta). If you have ectropion, your lower lid pulls away from your eye and tears don't drain properly into the puncta. The resulting signs and symptoms can include: Watery eyes (excessive tearing). Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids. Excessive dryness. Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy. Irritation. Stagnant tears or dryness can irritate your eyes, causing a burning sensation and redness in your eyelids and the whites of your eyes. Sensitivity to light. Stagnant tears or dry eyes can irritate the surface of the cornea, making you sensitive to light.

       " {'illness': 'Epilepsy',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion A staring spell Stiff muscles Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs Loss of consciousness or awareness Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. Some people experience deja vu. This type of seizure may also result in involuntary jerking of one body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream. During a focal seizure with impaired awareness, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, typically occur in children. They're characterized by staring into space with or without subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking and only last between 5-10 seconds. These seizures may occur in clusters, happening as often as 100 times per day, and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiff muscles and may affect consciousness. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. Since this most often affects the legs, it often causes you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches and usually affect the upper body, arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking. They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You're pregnant. You have diabetes. You've injured yourself during the seizure. You continue to have seizures even though you've been taking anti-seizure medication. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. \"},\n",

Possible indications that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include: Problems at school or work — frequently missing school or work, a sudden disinterest in school activities or work, or a drop in grades or work performance Physical health issues — lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes Neglected appearance — lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks Changes in behavior — exaggerated efforts to bar family members from entering his or her room or being secretive about where he or she goes with friends; or drastic changes in behavior and in relationships with family and friends Money issues — sudden requests for money without a reasonable explanation; or your discovery that money is missing or has been stolen or that items have disappeared from your home, indicating maybe they\\'re being sold to support drug use Recognizing signs of drug use or intoxication Signs and symptoms of drug use or intoxication may vary, depending on the type of drug. Below you\\'ll find several examples. Marijuana, hashish and other cannabis-containing substances People use cannabis by smoking, eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. Cannabis often precedes or is used along with other substances, such as alcohol or illegal drugs, and is often the first drug tried. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\" A heightened sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Increased blood pressure and heart rate Red eyes Dry mouth Decreased coordination Difficulty concentrating or remembering Slowed reaction time Anxiety or paranoid thinking Cannabis odor on clothes or yellow fingertips Exaggerated cravings for certain foods at unusual times Long-term (chronic) use is often associated with: Decreased mental sharpness Poor performance at school or at work Reduced number of friends and interests K2, Spice and bath salts Two groups of synthetic drugs — synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones — are illegal in most states. The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable, as there is no quality control and some ingredients may not be known. Synthetic cannabinoids, also called K2 or Spice, are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked, but can be prepared as an herbal tea. Despite manufacturer claims, these are chemical compounds rather than \"natural\" or harmless products. These drugs can produce a \"high\" similar to marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\" Elevated mood An altered sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Extreme anxiety or agitation Paranoia Hallucinations Increased heart rate and blood pressure or heart attack Vomiting Confusion Substituted cathinones, also called \"bath salts,\" are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection. Despite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted, inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in dangerous health effects or even death. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Euphoria Increased sociability Increased energy and agitation Increased sex drive Increased heart rate and blood pressure Problems thinking clearly Loss of muscle control Paranoia Panic attacks Hallucinations Delirium Psychotic and violent behavior Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. They\\'re often used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to \"switch off\" or forget stress-related thoughts or feelings. Barbiturates. Examples include phenobarbital and secobarbital (Seconal). Benzodiazepines. Examples include sedatives, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), clonazepam (Klonopin) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Hypnotics. Examples include prescription sleeping medications such as zolpidem (Ambien, Intermezzo, others) and zaleplon (Sonata). Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Drowsiness Slurred speech Lack of coordination Irritability or changes in mood Problems concentrating or thinking clearly Memory problems Involuntary eye movements Lack of inhibition Slowed breathing and reduced blood pressure Falls or accidents Dizziness Meth, cocaine and other stimulants Stimulants include amphetamines, meth (methamphetamine), cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others) and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Adderall XR, others). They are often used and misused in search of a \"high,\" or to boost energy, to improve performance at work or school, or to lose weight or control appetite. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Feeling of exhilaration and excess confidence Increased alertness Increased energy and restlessness Behavior changes or aggression Rapid or rambling speech Dilated pupils Confusion, delusions and hallucinations Irritability, anxiety or paranoia Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature Nausea or vomiting with weight loss Impaired judgment Nasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose (if snorting drugs) Mouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs (\"meth mouth\") Insomnia Depression as the drug wears off Club drugs Club drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties. Examples include ecstasy or molly (MDMA), gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), flunitrazepam (Rohypnol ― a brand used outside the U.S. ― also called roofie) and ketamine. These drugs are not all in the same category, but they share some similar effects and dangers, including long-term harmful effects. Because GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation, muscle relaxation, confusion and memory loss, the potential for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs. Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include: Hallucinations Paranoia Dilated pupils Chills and sweating Involuntary shaking (tremors) Behavior changes Muscle cramping and teeth clenching Muscle relaxation, poor coordination or problems moving Reduced inhibitions Heightened or altered sense of sight, sound and taste Poor judgment Memory problems or loss of memory Reduced consciousness Increased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure Hallucinogens Use of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug. The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP). LSD use may cause: Hallucinations Greatly reduced perception of reality, for example, interpreting input from one of your senses as another, such as hearing colors Impulsive behavior Rapid shifts in emotions Permanent mental changes in perception Rapid heart rate and high blood pressure Tremors Flashbacks, a re-experience of the hallucinations — even years later PCP use may cause: A feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings Hallucinations Problems with coordination and movement Aggressive, possibly violent behavior Involuntary eye movements Lack of pain sensation Increase in blood pressure and heart rate Problems with thinking and memory Problems speaking Impaired judgment Intolerance to loud noise Sometimes seizures or coma Inhalants Signs and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance. Some commonly inhaled substances include glue, paint thinners, correction fluid, felt tip marker fluid, gasoline, cleaning fluids and household aerosol products. Due to the toxic nature of these substances, users may develop brain damage or sudden death. Signs and symptoms of use can include: Possessing an inhalant substance without a reasonable explanation Brief euphoria or intoxication Decreased inhibition Combativeness or belligerence Dizziness Nausea or vomiting Involuntary eye movements Appearing intoxicated with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination Irregular heartbeats Tremors Lingering odor of inhalant material Rash around the nose and mouth Opioid painkillers Opioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. This class of drugs includes, among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone and oxycodone. Sometimes called the \"opioid epidemic,\" addiction to opioid prescription pain medications has reached an alarming rate across the United States. Some people who\\'ve been using opioids over a long period of time may need physician-prescribed temporary or long-term drug substitution during treatment. Signs and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include: Reduced sense of pain Agitation, drowsiness or sedation Slurred speech Problems with attention and memory Constricted pupils Lack of awareness or inattention to surrounding people and things Problems with coordination Depression Confusion Constipation Runny nose or nose sores (if snorting drugs) Needle marks (if injecting drugs) When to see a doctor If your drug use is out of control or causing problems, get help. The sooner you seek help, the greater your chances for a long-term recovery. Talk with your primary doctor or see a mental health professional, such as a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry, or a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Make an appointment to see a doctor if: You can\\'t stop using a drug You continue using the drug despite the harm it causes Your drug use has led to unsafe behavior, such as sharing needles or unprotected sex You think you may be having withdrawal symptoms after stopping drug use If you\\'re not ready to approach a doctor, help lines or hotlines may be a good place to learn about treatment. You can find these lines listed on the internet or in the phone book. When to seek emergency help Seek emergency help if you or someone you know has taken a drug and: May have overdosed Shows changes in consciousness Has trouble breathing Has seizures or convulsions Has signs of a possible heart attack, such as chest pain or pressure Has any other troublesome physical or psychological reaction to use of the drug Staging an intervention People struggling with addiction usually deny that their drug use is problematic and are reluctant to seek treatment. An intervention presents a loved one with a structured opportunity to make changes before things get even worse and can motivate someone to seek or accept help. An intervention should be carefully planned and may be done by family and friends in consultation with a doctor or professional such as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor, or directed by an intervention professional. It involves family and friends and sometimes co-workers, clergy or others who care about the person struggling with addiction. During the intervention, these people gather together to have a direct, heart-to-heart conversation with the person about the consequences of addiction and ask him or her to accept treatment.

In extreme cases, the joint may become dislocated. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have severe pain in a joint that comes on suddenly. Prompt treatment can help minimize joint damage. If you have an artificial joint, see your doctor if you experience pain while using the joint. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

Frontal fibrosing alopecia Frontal fibrosing alopecia Frontal fibrosing alopecia Early treatment of a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia) might help avoid significant permanent baldness. The cause of this condition is unknown, but it primarily affects older women. Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include: Gradual thinning on top of head. This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia). Circular or patchy bald spots. Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. Sudden loosening of hair. A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary. Full-body hair loss. Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back. Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you are distressed by persistent hair loss in you or your child and want to pursue treatment. For women who are experiencing a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia), talk with your doctor about early treatment to avoid significant permanent baldness. Also talk to your doctor if you notice sudden or patchy hair loss or more than usual hair loss when combing or washing your or your child's hair.

       "  'symptoms': 'Children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) may have many speech symptoms or characteristics that vary depending on their age and the severity of their speech problems. CAS can be associated with: Delayed onset of first words A limited number of spoken words The ability to form only a few consonant or vowel sounds These symptoms are usually noticed between ages 18 months and 2 years, and may indicate suspected CAS. As children produce more speech, usually between ages 2 and 4, characteristics that likely indicate CAS include: Vowel and consonant distortions Separation of syllables in or between words Voicing errors, such as \"pie\" sounding like \"bye\" Many children with CAS have difficulty getting their jaws, lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound, and they may have difficulty moving smoothly to the next sound. Many children with CAS also have language problems, such as reduced vocabulary or difficulty with word order. Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS and can be helpful to diagnose the problem. However, some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. It\\'s difficult to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other types of speech or language disorders. Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. Those particularly associated with CAS include: Difficulty moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another Groping movements with the jaw, lips or tongue to make the correct movement for speech sounds Vowel distortions, such as attempting to use the correct vowel, but saying it incorrectly Using the wrong stress in a word, such as pronouncing \"banana\" as \"BUH-nan-uh\" instead of \"buh-NAN-uh\" Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying \"BUH-NAN-UH\" Separation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables Inconsistency, such as making different errors when trying to say the same word a second time Difficulty imitating simple words Inconsistent voicing errors, such as saying \"down\" instead of \"town\" Other characteristics are seen in most children with speech or language problems and aren\\'t helpful in distinguishing CAS. Characteristics seen both in children with CAS and in children with other types of speech or language disorders include: Babbling less or making fewer vocal sounds than is typical between the ages of 7 to 12 months old Speaking first words late (after ages 12 to 18 months old) Using a limited number of consonants and vowels Frequently leaving out (omitting) sounds Using speech that is difficult to understand speech Other speech disorders sometimes confused with CAS Some speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the characteristics may overlap. These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders, phonological disorders and dysarthria. A child who has trouble learning how to make specific sounds, but doesn\\'t have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak, may have an articulation or phonological disorder. Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS. Articulation or phonological speech errors may include: Substituting sounds, such as saying \"fum\" instead of \"thumb,\" \"wabbit\" instead of \"rabbit\" or \"tup\" instead of \"cup\" Leaving out (omitting) final consonants, such as saying \"duh\" instead of \"duck\" or \"uh\" instead of \"up\" Stopping the airstream, such as saying \"tun\" instead of \"sun\" or \"doo\" instead of \"zoo\" Simplifying sound combinations, such as saying \"ting\" instead of \"string\" or \"fog\" instead of \"frog\" Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that is due to weakness, spasticity or inability to control the speech muscles. Making speech sounds is difficult because the speech muscles can\\'t move as far, as quickly or as strongly as normal. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice, or slurred or slow speech. Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. However, when dysarthria is caused by damage to certain areas of the brain that affect coordination, it can be difficult to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria.

Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain. Some people have no symptoms. For others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest. However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the chance you're having a heart attack. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning might be recurrent chest pain or pressure (angina) that's triggered by activity and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart. When to see a doctor Act immediately. Some people wait too long because they don't recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps: Call for emergency medical help. If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk. Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor. Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help. Take aspirin, if recommended. Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don't take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first. What to do if you see someone who might be having a heart attack If you see someone who's unconscious and you believe is having a heart attack, first call for emergency medical help. Then check if the person is breathing and has a pulse. If the person isn't breathing or you don't find a pulse, only then should you begin CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm — about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. If you haven't been trained in CPR, doctors recommend performing only chest compressions. If you have been trained in CPR, you can go on to opening the airway and rescue breathing. \"},\n",

Obsessions often have themes to them, such as: Fear of contamination or dirt Doubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty Needing things orderly and symmetrical Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include: Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way Images of driving your car into a crowd of people Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public Unpleasant sexual images Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands Compulsion symptoms OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety. You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix. As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as: Washing and cleaning Checking Counting Orderliness Following a strict routine Demanding reassurance Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include: Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked Checking the stove repeatedly to make sure it's off Counting in certain patterns Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase Arranging your canned goods to face the same way Severity varies OCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it can start in childhood. Symptoms usually begin gradually and tend to vary in severity throughout life. The types of obsessions and compulsions you experience can also change over time. Symptoms generally worsen when you experience greater stress. OCD, usually considered a lifelong disorder, can have mild to moderate symptoms or be so severe and time-consuming that it becomes disabling. When to see a doctor There's a difference between being a perfectionist — someone who requires flawless results or performance, for example — and having OCD. OCD thoughts aren't simply excessive worries about real problems in your life or liking to have things clean or arranged in a specific way. If your obsessions and compulsions are affecting your quality of life, see your doctor or mental health professional. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

However, some people with colon polyps may experience: Rectal bleeding. This can be a sign of colon polyps or cancer or other conditions, such as hemorrhoids or minor tears of the anus. Change in stool color. Blood can show up as red streaks in your stool or make stool appear black. A change in color may also be caused by certain foods, medications or dietary supplements. Change in bowel habits. Constipation or diarrhea that lasts longer than a week may indicate the presence of a larger colon polyp or cancer. However, a number of other conditions also can cause changes in bowel habits. Pain. A large colon polyp can partially obstruct your bowel, leading to crampy abdominal pain. Iron deficiency anemia. Bleeding from polyps can occur slowly over time, without visible blood in your stool. Chronic bleeding robs your body of the iron needed to produce the substance that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body (hemoglobin). The result is iron deficiency anemia, which can make you feel tired and short of breath. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience: Abdominal pain Blood in your stool A change in your bowel habits that lasts longer than a week You should be screened regularly for polyps if: You're age 50 or older. You have risk factors, such as a family history of colon cancer. Some high-risk individuals should begin regular screening much earlier than age 50. \"},\n",

Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may differ greatly from person to person and over the course of the disease depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms often affect movement, such as: Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your body at a time, or your legs and trunk Electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward (Lhermitte sign) Tremor, lack of coordination or unsteady gait Vision problems are also common, including: Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time, often with pain during eye movement Prolonged double vision Blurry vision Multiple sclerosis symptoms may also include: Slurred speech Fatigue Dizziness Tingling or pain in parts of your body Problems with sexual, bowel and bladder function When to see a doctor See a doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms for unknown reasons. Disease course Most people with MS have a relapsing-remitting disease course. They experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen signs and symptoms of MS, but these aren't considered true disease relapses. At least 50% of those with relapsing-remitting MS eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms, with or without periods of remission, within 10 to 20 years from disease onset. This is known as secondary-progressive MS. The worsening of symptoms usually includes problems with mobility and gait. The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary-progressive MS.

The signs and symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson\\'s disease, such as: Rigid muscles Difficulty bending your arms and legs Slow movement (bradykinesia) Tremors (rare in MSA compared with classic Parkinson\\'s disease) Problems with posture and balance Cerebellar type The main signs and symptoms are problems with muscle coordination (ataxia), but others may include: Impaired movement and coordination, such as unsteady gait and loss of balance Slurred, slow or low-volume speech (dysarthria) Visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision and difficulty focusing your eyes Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or chewing General signs and symptoms In addition, the primary sign of multiple system atrophy is: Postural (orthostatic) hypotension, a form of low blood pressure that makes you feel dizzy or lightheaded, or even faint, when you stand up from sitting or lying down You can also develop dangerously high blood pressure levels while lying down (supine hypertension). MSA might cause other difficulties with involuntary (autonomic) body functions, including: Urinary and bowel dysfunction Constipation Loss of bladder or bowel control (incontinence) Sweating abnormalities Reduced production of sweat, tears and saliva Heat intolerance due to reduced sweating Impaired body temperature control, often causing cold hands or feet Sleep disorders Agitated sleep due to \"acting out\" dreams Abnormal breathing at night Sexual dysfunction Inability to achieve or maintain an erection (impotence) Loss of libido Cardiovascular problems Color changes in hands and feet caused by pooling of blood Cold hands and feet Psychiatric problems Difficulty controlling emotions, such as laughing or crying inappropriately When to see a doctor If you develop any of the signs and symptoms associated with multiple system atrophy, see your doctor for an evaluation and diagnosis.

There are many types of phobias, and it's not unusual to experience a specific phobia about more than one object or situation. Specific phobias can also occur along with other types of anxiety disorders. Common categories of specific phobias are a fear of: Situations, such as airplanes, enclosed spaces or going to school Nature, such as thunderstorms or heights Animals or insects, such as dogs or spiders Blood, injection or injury, such as needles, accidents or medical procedures Others, such as choking, vomiting, loud noises or clowns Each specific phobia is referred to by its own term. Examples of more common terms include acrophobia for the fear of heights and claustrophobia for the fear of confined spaces. No matter what specific phobia you have, it's likely to produce these types of reactions: An immediate feeling of intense fear, anxiety and panic when exposed to or even thinking about the source of your fear Awareness that your fears are unreasonable or exaggerated but feeling powerless to control them Worsening anxiety as the situation or object gets closer to you in time or physical proximity Doing everything possible to avoid the object or situation or enduring it with intense anxiety or fear Difficulty functioning normally because of your fear Physical reactions and sensations, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or difficulty breathing Feeling nauseated, dizzy or fainting around blood or injuries In children, possibly tantrums, clinging, crying, or refusing to leave a parent's side or approach their fear When to see a doctor An unreasonable fear can be an annoyance — having to take the stairs instead of an elevator or driving the long way to work instead of taking the freeway, for instance — but it isn't considered a specific phobia unless it seriously disrupts your life. If anxiety negatively affects functioning in work, school or social situations, talk with your doctor or a mental health professional. Childhood fears, such as fear of the dark, of monsters or of being left alone, are common, and most children outgrow them. But if your child has a persistent, excessive fear that interferes with daily functioning at home or school, talk to your child's doctor. Most people can be helped with the right therapy.

Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax You can contract anthrax when spores penetrate your skin, usually through an open wound. The infection begins as a raised, sometimes itchy, bump resembling an insect bite. But within a day or two, the bump develops into an open, usually painless sore with a black center. A skin-related (cutaneous) anthrax infection enters your body through your skin, usually through a cut or other sore. It's by far the most common route of the disease. It's also the mildest. With appropriate treatment, cutaneous anthrax is seldom fatal. Signs and symptoms include: A raised, itchy bump resembling an insect bite that quickly develops into a painless sore with a black center Swelling in the sore and nearby lymph glands Sometimes, flu-like symptoms including fever and headache Gastrointestinal anthrax A gastrointestinal anthrax infection results from eating undercooked meat from an infected animal. It can affect your gastrointestinal tract from your throat to your colon.

Inhalation anthrax develops when you breathe in anthrax spores. It's the most deadly form of the disease, and is often fatal, even with treatment. Initial signs and symptoms include: Flu-like symptoms for a few hours or days, such as sore throat, mild fever, fatigue and muscle aches Mild chest discomfort Shortness of breath Nausea Coughing up blood Painful swallowing High fever Trouble breathing Shock — an acute medical condition involving collapse of the circulatory system Meningitis Injection anthrax This recently identified route of anthrax infection has so far been reported only in Europe. It's contracted through injecting illegal drugs. Initial signs and symptoms include: Redness at the area of injection (without an area that changes to black) Significant swelling Shock Multiple organ failure Meningitis When to see a doctor Many common illnesses start with symptoms that resemble the flu. The chances that your sore throat and aching muscles are due to anthrax are extremely small. If you think you may have been exposed — for example, if you work in an environment where anthrax is likely to occur — see a doctor immediately for evaluation and care. If you develop signs and symptoms of the disorder after exposure to animals or animal products in parts of the world where anthrax is common, seek prompt medical attention.

The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism vary, depending on the severity of the hormone deficiency. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over a number of years. At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may simply attribute them to getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. Hypothyroidism signs and symptoms may include: Fatigue Increased sensitivity to cold Constipation Dry skin Weight gain Puffy face Hoarseness Muscle weakness Elevated blood cholesterol level Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness Pain, stiffness or swelling in your joints Heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods Thinning hair Slowed heart rate Depression Impaired memory Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) Hypothyroidism in infants Although hypothyroidism most often affects middle-aged and older women, anyone can develop the condition, including infants. Initially, babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work properly may have few signs and symptoms. When newborns do have problems with hypothyroidism, the problems may include: Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). In most cases, this occurs when a baby's liver can't metabolize a substance called bilirubin, which normally forms when the body recycles old or damaged red blood cells. A large, protruding tongue. Difficulty breathing. Hoarse crying. An umbilical hernia. As the disease progresses, infants are likely to have trouble feeding and may fail to grow and develop normally. They may also have: Constipation Poor muscle tone Excessive sleepiness When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental retardation. Hypothyroidism in children and teens In general, children and teens who develop hypothyroidism have the same signs and symptoms as adults do, but they may also experience: Poor growth, resulting in short stature Delayed development of permanent teeth Delayed puberty Poor mental development When to see a doctor See your doctor if you're feeling tired for no reason or have any of the other signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as dry skin, a pale, puffy face, constipation or a hoarse voice.

       " {'illness': 'Factitious disorder',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Factitious disorder symptoms involve mimicking or producing illness or injury or exaggerating symptoms or impairment to deceive others. People with the disorder go to great lengths to hide their deception, so it may be difficult to realize that their symptoms are actually part of a serious mental health disorder. They continue with the deception, even without receiving any visible benefit or reward or when faced with objective evidence that doesn't support their claims. Factitious disorder signs and symptoms may include: Clever and convincing medical or psychological problems Extensive knowledge of medical terms and diseases Vague or inconsistent symptoms Conditions that get worse for no apparent reason Conditions that don't respond as expected to standard therapies Seeking treatment from many different doctors or hospitals, which may include using a fake name Reluctance to allow doctors to talk to family or friends or to other health care professionals Frequent stays in the hospital Eagerness to have frequent testing or risky operations Many surgical scars or evidence of numerous procedures Having few visitors when hospitalized Arguing with doctors and staff Factious disorder imposed on another Factitious disorder imposed on another (previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy) is when someone falsely claims that another person has physical or psychological signs or symptoms of illness, or causes injury or disease in another person with the intention of deceiving others. People with this disorder present another person as sick, injured or having problems functioning, claiming that medical attention is needed. Usually this involves a parent harming a child. This form of abuse can put a child in serious danger of injury or unnecessary medical care. How those with factitious disorder fake illness Because people with factitious disorder become experts at faking symptoms and diseases or inflicting real injuries upon themselves, it may be hard for health care professionals and loved ones to know if illnesses are real or not. People with factitious disorder make up symptoms or cause illnesses in several ways, such as: Exaggerating existing symptoms. Even when an actual medical or psychological condition exists, they may exaggerate symptoms to appear sicker or more impaired than is true. Making up histories. They may give loved ones, health care professionals or support groups a false medical history, such as claiming to have had cancer or AIDS. Or they may falsify medical records to indicate an illness. Faking symptoms. They may fake symptoms, such as stomach pain, seizures or passing out. Causing self-harm. They may make themselves sick, for example, by injecting themselves with bacteria, milk, gasoline or feces. They may injure, cut or burn themselves. They may take medications, such as blood thinners or drugs for diabetes, to mimic diseases. They may also interfere with wound healing, such as reopening or infecting cuts. Tampering. They may manipulate medical instruments to skew results, such as heating up thermometers. Or they may tamper with lab tests, such as contaminating their urine samples with blood or other substances. When to see a doctor People with factitious disorder may be well aware of the risk of injury or even death as a result of self-harm or the treatment they seek, but they can't control their behaviors and they're unlikely to seek help. Even when confronted with objective proof — such as a videotape — that they're causing their illness, they often deny it and refuse psychiatric help. If you think a loved one may be exaggerating or faking health problems, it may help to attempt a gentle conversation about your concerns. Try to avoid anger, judgment or confrontation. Also try to reinforce and encourage more healthy, productive activities rather than focusing on dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors. Offer support and caring and, if possible, help in finding treatment. If your loved one causes self-inflicted injury or attempts suicide, call 911 or emergency medical help or, if you can safely do so, take him or her to an emergency room immediately.

As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you\\'re likely in late perimenopause. Hot flashes and sleep problems. Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them. Mood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause. Vaginal and bladder problems. When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence. Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you\\'re having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you\\'ve had no periods for 12 months. Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond. Loss of bone. With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones. Changing cholesterol levels. Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the \"good\" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease. When to see a doctor Some women seek medical attention for their perimenopausal symptoms. But others either tolerate the changes or simply don\\'t experience symptoms severe enough to need attention. Because symptoms may be subtle and come on gradually, you may not realize at first that they\\'re all connected to the same thing — hormone fluctuations of the menopausal transition.

However, the symptoms tend to progress over time, usually reaching their worst within a few years after the onset of the disease. Although myasthenia gravis can affect any of the muscles that you control voluntarily, certain muscle groups are more commonly affected than others. Eye muscles In more than half of people who develop myasthenia gravis, their first signs and symptoms involve eye problems, such as: Drooping of one or both eyelids (ptosis) Double vision (diplopia), which may be horizontal or vertical, and improves or resolves when one eye is closed Face and throat muscles In about 15% of people with myasthenia gravis, the first symptoms involve face and throat muscles, which can: Impair speaking. Your speech might sound soft or nasal, depending on which muscles have been affected. Cause difficulty swallowing. You might choke easily, making it difficult to eat, drink or take pills. In some cases, liquids you're trying to swallow come out your nose. Affect chewing. The muscles used for chewing might tire halfway through a meal, particularly if you've been eating something hard to chew, such as steak. Change facial expressions. For example, your smile might look like a snarl. Neck and limb muscles Myasthenia gravis can also cause weakness in your neck, arms and legs. Weakness in your legs can affect how you walk.

When to see a doctor Because physical symptoms can be related to medical problems, it's important to be evaluated by your primary care provider if you aren't sure what's causing your symptoms. If your primary care provider believes that you may have somatic symptom disorder, he or she can refer you to a mental health professional.

       "  'symptoms': \"A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include: Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment. Odontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes. Other types of cysts and tumors. These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others. When to see a doctor If you're concerned that you may have symptoms of a jaw tumor or cyst, talk with your primary care provider or dentist. Many times, jaw cysts and tumors do not have symptoms and are typically discovered on routine screening X-rays done for other reasons.

ADHD symptoms start before age 12, and in some children, they're noticeable as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood. ADHD occurs more often in males than in females, and behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive. There are three subtypes of ADHD : Predominantly inattentive. The majority of symptoms fall under inattention. Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive. The majority of symptoms are hyperactive and impulsive. Combined. This is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. Inattention A child who shows a pattern of inattention may often: Fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork Have trouble staying focused in tasks or play Appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly Have difficulty following through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork or chores Have trouble organizing tasks and activities Avoid or dislike tasks that require focused mental effort, such as homework Lose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils Be easily distracted Forget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores Hyperactivity and impulsivity A child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often: Fidget with or tap his or her hands or feet, or squirm in the seat Have difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situations Be on the go, in constant motion Run around or climb in situations when it's not appropriate Have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly Talk too much Blurt out answers, interrupting the questioner Have difficulty waiting for his or her turn Interrupt or intrude on others' conversations, games or activities Typical developmental behavior vs. ADHD Most healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It's typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and be unable to stick with one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest. The same is true of hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic — they often are still full of energy long after they've worn their parents out. In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings. Children who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends are likely struggling with something other than ADHD. The same is true of children who are hyperactive or inattentive at home, but whose schoolwork and friendships remain unaffected. When to see a doctor If you're concerned that your child shows signs of ADHD, see your pediatrician or family doctor. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, psychiatrist or pediatric neurologist, but it's important to have a medical evaluation first to check for other possible causes of your child's difficulties.

The main symptom is memory loss that\\'s more severe than normal forgetfulness and that can\\'t be explained by a medical condition. You can\\'t recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic time. Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat, or more rarely, can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. It may sometimes involve travel or confused wandering away from your life (dissociative fugue). An episode of amnesia usually occurs suddenly and may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years. Dissociative identity disorder. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by \"switching\" to alternate identities. You may feel the presence of two or more people talking or living inside your head, and you may feel as though you\\'re possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and characteristics, including obvious differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. People with dissociative identity disorder typically also have dissociative amnesia and often have dissociative fugue. Depersonalization-derealization disorder. This involves an ongoing or episodic sense of detachment or being outside yourself — observing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance as though watching a movie (depersonalization). Other people and things around you may feel detached and foggy or dreamlike, time may be slowed down or sped up, and the world may seem unreal (derealization). You may experience depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms, which can be profoundly distressing, may last only a few moments or come and go over many years. When to see a doctor Some people with dissociative disorders present in a crisis with traumatic flashbacks that are overwhelming or associated with unsafe behavior. People with these symptoms should be seen in an emergency room. If you or a loved one has less urgent symptoms that may indicate a dissociative disorder, call your doctor. Suicidal thoughts or behavior If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend.

A person with alcohol poisoning who is unconscious or can't be awakened is at risk of dying. Alcohol poisoning is an emergency If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning — even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms — seek immediate medical care. Here's what to do: Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning. Be prepared to provide information. If you know, be sure to tell hospital or emergency personnel the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when. Don't leave an unconscious person alone. Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may choke on his or her own vomit and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because he or she could choke. Help a person who is vomiting. Try to keep him or her sitting up. If the person must lie down, make sure to turn his or her head to the side — this helps prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake to prevent loss of consciousness. Don't be afraid to get help It can be difficult to decide if you think someone is drunk enough to warrant medical intervention, but it's best to err on the side of caution.

Cognitive disorders Cognitive impairments often associated with Huntington's disease include: Difficulty organizing, prioritizing or focusing on tasks Lack of flexibility or the tendency to get stuck on a thought, behavior or action (perseveration) Lack of impulse control that can result in outbursts, acting without thinking and sexual promiscuity Lack of awareness of one's own behaviors and abilities Slowness in processing thoughts or ''finding'' words Difficulty in learning new information Psychiatric disorders The most common psychiatric disorder associated with Huntington's disease is depression. This isn't simply a reaction to receiving a diagnosis of Huntington's disease. Instead, depression appears to occur because of injury to the brain and subsequent changes in brain function. Signs and symptoms may include: Feelings of irritability, sadness or apathy Social withdrawal Insomnia Fatigue and loss of energy Frequent thoughts of death, dying or suicide Other common psychiatric disorders include: Obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition marked by recurrent, intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors Mania, which can cause elevated mood, overactivity, impulsive behavior and inflated self-esteem Bipolar disorder, a condition with alternating episodes of depression and mania In addition to the above disorders, weight loss is common in people with Huntington's disease, especially as the disease progresses.

The disease might affect only one or two areas of your body or might be widespread. Your signs and symptoms, if any, will depend on the affected part of your body. Pelvis. Paget's disease of bone in the pelvis can cause hip pain. Skull. An overgrowth of bone in the skull can cause hearing loss or headaches. Spine. If your spine is affected, nerve roots can become compressed. This can cause pain, tingling and numbness in an arm or leg. Leg. As the bones weaken, they may bend — causing you to become bowlegged. Enlarged and misshapen bones in your legs can put extra stress on nearby joints, which may cause osteoarthritis in your knee or hip.

In adults and older children, RSV usually causes mild cold-like signs and symptoms. These may include: Congested or runny nose Dry cough Low-grade fever Sore throat Sneezing Headache In severe cases RSV infection can spread to the lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia or bronchiolitis — inflammation of the small airway passages entering the lungs. Signs and symptoms may include: Fever Severe cough Wheezing — a high-pitched noise that's usually heard on breathing out (exhaling) Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing — the person may prefer to sit up rather than lie down Bluish color of the skin due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis) Infants are most severely affected by RSV. Signs and symptoms of severe RSV infection in infants include: Short, shallow and rapid breathing Struggling to breathe — chest muscles and skin pull inward with each breath Cough Poor feeding Unusual tiredness (lethargy) Irritability Most children and adults recover in one to two weeks, although some might have repeated wheezing. Severe or life-threatening infection requiring a hospital stay may occur in premature infants or in anyone who has chronic heart or lung problems. RSV and COVID-19 Because RSV and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are both types of respiratory viruses, some symptoms of RSV and COVID-19 can be similar. In children, COVID-19 often results in mild symptoms such as fever, runny nose and cough. For adults with COVID-19, symptoms may be more severe and may include trouble breathing. Having RSV may lower immunity and increase the risk of getting COVID-19 — for kids and adults. And these infections may occur together, which can worsen the severity of COVID-19 illness. If you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, your doctor may recommend testing for COVID-19.

Features of colic may include the following: Intense crying that may seem more like screaming or an expression of pain Crying for no apparent reason, unlike crying to express hunger or the need for a diaper change Extreme fussiness even after crying has diminished Predictable timing, with episodes often occurring in the evening Facial discoloring, such as reddening of the face or paler skin around the mouth Bodily tension, such as pulled up or stiffened legs, stiffened arms, clenched fists, arched back, or tense abdomen Sometimes there is relief in symptoms after the infant passes gas or has a bowel movement. Gas is likely the result of swallowed air during prolonged crying.

A few people with high blood pressure may have headaches, shortness of breath or nosebleeds, but these signs and symptoms aren't specific and usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage. When to see a doctor You'll likely have your blood pressure taken as part of a routine doctor's appointment. Ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18. If you're age 40 or older, or you're 18 to 39 with a high risk of high blood pressure, ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading every year. Blood pressure generally should be checked in both arms to determine if there's a difference. It's important to use an appropriate-sized arm cuff. Your doctor will likely recommend more-frequent readings if you've already been diagnosed with high blood pressure or have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Children age 3 and older will usually have blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups. If you don't regularly see your doctor, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community. You can also find machines in some stores that will measure your blood pressure for free. Public blood pressure machines, such as those found in pharmacies, may provide helpful information about your blood pressure, but they may have some limitations.

       " {'illness': 'Prader-Willi syndrome',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome can vary among individuals. Symptoms may slowly change over time from childhood to adulthood. Infants Signs and symptoms that may be present from birth include: Poor muscle tone. A primary sign during infancy is poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed, and they may feel floppy or like rag dolls when they're held. Distinct facial features. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip. Poor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone. Poor sucking makes feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive. Generally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem unusually tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry. Underdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicles may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In females, the clitoris and labia may be small. Early childhood to adulthood Other features of Prader-Willi syndrome appear during early childhood and remain throughout life, requiring careful management. These features may include: Food craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food, resulting in rapid weight gain, starting around age 2 years. Constant hunger leads to eating often and consuming large portions. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food, or eating frozen food or even garbage, may develop. Underdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organs (testes in men and ovaries in women) produce little or no sex hormones. This results in underdeveloped sex organs, incomplete or delayed puberty, and in nearly all cases, infertility. Without treatment, women may not start menstruating until their 30s or may never menstruate, and men may not have much facial hair and their voices may never fully deepen. Poor growth and physical development. Underproduction of growth hormone can result in short adult height, low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problems may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency, which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections. Cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate intellectual disability, such as issues with thinking, reasoning and problem-solving, is a common feature of the disorder. Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities. Delayed motor development. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestones in physical movement — for example, sitting up or walking — later than other children do. Speech problems. Speech is often delayed. Poor articulation of words may be an ongoing problem into adulthood. Behavioral problems. Children and adults may at times be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food, and may not tolerate changes in routine. They may also develop obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and skin picking, may develop. Sleep disorders. Children and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome may have sleep disorders, including disruptions of the normal sleep cycle and a condition in which breathing pauses during sleep (sleep apnea). These disorders can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and worsen behavior problems. Other signs and symptoms. These may include small hands and feet, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), hip problems, reduced saliva flow, nearsightedness and other vision problems, problems regulating body temperature, a high pain tolerance, or a lack of pigment (hypopigmentation) causing hair, eyes and skin to be pale. When to see a doctor Regularly scheduled well-baby visits can help identify early signs of poor growth and development, which can be signs of Prader-Willi syndrome or other disorders. If you have concerns about your baby's health between well-baby visits, schedule an appointment with your child's doctor. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

Other symptoms usually start two to eight weeks after infection. Possibly no signs or symptoms Mild cases of trichinosis — those with only a small number of parasites in your body — may cause no recognizable signs or symptoms. Symptoms can develop with moderate or heavy infestation, sometimes progressing as the parasite travels through your body. Initial signs and symptoms You swallow trichinella larvae encased in a cyst. Your digestive juices dissolve the cyst, releasing the parasite into your body. The larvae then penetrate the wall of the small intestine, where they mature into adult worms and mate. At this stage, you may experience: Diarrhea Abdominal pain Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Later signs and symptoms About a week after infection, the adult female worms produce larvae that go through the intestinal wall, enter your bloodstream, and eventually burrow into muscle or other tissue. This tissue invasion can cause: High fever Muscle pain and tenderness Swelling of the eyelids or face Weakness Headache Sensitivity to light Pink eye (conjunctivitis) When to see a doctor If you have a mild case of trichinosis with no symptoms, you might not need medical attention.

Signs and symptoms of a strangulated hernia include: Nausea, vomiting or both Fever Sudden pain that quickly intensifies A hernia bulge that turns red, purple or dark Inability to move your bowels or pass gas When to see a doctor Seek immediate care if a hernia bulge turns red, purple or dark or if you notice any other signs or symptoms of a strangulated hernia. See your doctor if you have a painful or noticeable bulge in your groin on either side of your pubic bone. The bulge is likely to be more noticeable when you're standing, and you usually can feel it if you put your hand directly over the affected area. \"},\n",

Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes? It could be eye floaters. \"In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called \\'the vitreous.\\' When we\\'re young, it\\'s a firm clump of jelly. As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces. Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floaters,\" says Dr. Khan. Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you\\'re nearsighted. The biggest concern – they can cause retinal tears. \"If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall,\" says Dr. Khan. \"And that\\'s a retinal detachment.\" And that can cause blindness, which is why it\\'s especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision. Most eye floaters don\\'t require treatment, but your eye doctor likely will recommend regular eye exams to ensure the condition doesn\\'t worsen. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor See your doctor if: You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes? It could be eye floaters. \"In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called \\'the vitreous.\\' When we\\'re young, it\\'s a firm clump of jelly. As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces. Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floaters,\" says Dr. Khan. Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you\\'re nearsighted. The biggest concern – they can cause retinal tears. \"If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall,\" says Dr. Khan. \"And that\\'s a retinal detachment.\" And that can cause blindness, which is why it\\'s especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision.

       " {'illness': 'Childhood schizophrenia',\n",
       "  'symptoms': 'Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases. Early signs and symptoms Schizophrenia signs and symptoms in children and teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group. Early signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions. Thinking: Problems with thinking and reasoning Bizarre ideas or speech Confusing dreams or television for reality Behavior: Withdrawal from friends and family Trouble sleeping Lack of motivation — for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing Bizarre behavior Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation Recreational drug or nicotine use Emotions: Irritability or depressed mood Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation Strange anxieties and fears Excessive suspicion of others Later signs and symptoms As children with schizophrenia age, more typical signs and symptoms of the disorder begin to appear. Signs and symptoms may include: Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you\\'re being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don\\'t exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking. Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can\\'t be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion — doesn\\'t make eye contact, doesn\\'t change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn\\'t add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure. Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be: Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations Symptoms may be difficult to interpret When childhood schizophrenia begins early in life, symptoms may build up gradually. Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can\\'t recognize what\\'s wrong. Some early signs can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptoms of other mental or physical conditions. As time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable. Eventually, your child may develop the symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions and difficulty organizing thoughts. As thoughts become more disorganized, there\\'s often a \"break from reality\" (psychosis) frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment with medication. When to see a doctor It can be difficult to know how to handle vague behavioral changes in your child. You may be afraid of rushing to conclusions that label your child with a mental illness. Your child\\'s teacher or other school staff may alert you to changes in your child\\'s behavior. Seek medical care as soon as possible if you have concerns about your child\\'s behavior or development. Suicidal thoughts and behavior Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with schizophrenia. If you have a child or teen who is in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with him or her. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or if you think you can do so safely, take your child to the nearest hospital emergency room. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

You may excessively focus over one or more parts of your body. The feature that you focus on may change over time. The most common features people tend to fixate about include: Face, such as nose, complexion, wrinkles, acne and other blemishes Hair, such as appearance, thinning and baldness Skin and vein appearance Breast size Muscle size and tone Genitalia A preoccupation with your body build being too small or not muscular enough (muscle dysmorphia) occurs almost exclusively in males. Insight about body dysmorphic disorder varies. You may recognize that your beliefs about your perceived flaws may be excessive or not be true, or think that they probably are true, or be absolutely convinced that they're true. The more convinced you are of your beliefs, the more distress and disruption you may experience in your life. When to see a doctor Shame and embarrassment about your appearance may keep you from seeking treatment for body dysmorphic disorder. But if you have any signs or symptoms, see your primary care provider or a mental health professional. Body dysmorphic disorder usually doesn't get better on its own. If left untreated, it may get worse over time, leading to anxiety, extensive medical bills, severe depression, and even suicidal thoughts and behavior. If you have suicidal thoughts Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common with body dysmorphic disorder. If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, get help right away: Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Call a suicide hotline number. In the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK ( 1-800-273-8255 ) or use its webchat at suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat. Call your mental health professional. Seek help from your primary care provider. Reach out to a close friend or loved one. Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.

Cystic acne Cystic acne Cystic acne Cystic acne — the most severe form of acne — occurs when oil and dead skin cells build up deep within hair follicles. The resulting rupture within your skin may form boil-like inflammation. Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) Blackheads (open plugged pores) Small red, tender bumps (papules) Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. When to see a doctor If self-care remedies don't clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications. If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist).

After that, signs and symptoms start to appear. The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity can vary greatly from child to child. Rett syndrome signs and symptoms include: Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than normal head size (microcephaly) is usually the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, delayed growth in other parts of the body becomes evident. Loss of normal movement and coordination. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk normally. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or may become rigid or spastic with abnormal movement and positioning. Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of speech. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Abnormal hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome typically develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements that may differ for each person. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing. Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time. Breathing problems. These include breath-holding, abnormally rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forceful exhalation of air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours, but breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or periodic breathing can occur during sleep. Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety. Other abnormal behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing. Cognitive disabilities. Loss of skills can be accompanied by a loss of intellectual functioning. Seizures. Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives. Multiple seizure types may occur and are accompanied by an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). Abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and increases with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe. Irregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death. Sleep disturbances. Abnormal sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming. Other symptoms. A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as thin, fragile bones prone to factures; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding. Stages of Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages: Stage I: early onset. Signs and symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which starts between 6 and 18 months of age and can last for a few months or a year. Babies in this stage may show less eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delays in sitting or crawling. Stage II: rapid deterioration. Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such as slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or crying for no apparent reason, problems with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication. Stage III: plateau. The third stage usually begins between the ages of 2 and 10 years and can last for many years. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may have limited improvement, with less crying and irritability, and some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2. Stage IV: late motor deterioration. This stage usually begins after the age of 10 and can last for years or decades. It's marked by reduced mobility, muscle weakness, joint contractures and scoliosis. Understanding, communication and hand skills generally remain stable or improve slightly, and seizures may occur less often. When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of Rett syndrome can be subtle in the early stages. See your child's doctor right away if you begin to notice physical problems or changes in behavior after apparently normal development, such as: Slowed growth of your child's head or other parts of the body Decreased coordination or mobility Repetitive hand movements Decreasing eye contact or loss of interest in normal play Delayed speech development or loss of previously acquired speech abilities Problem behavior or marked mood swings Any clear loss of previously gained milestones in gross motor or fine motor skills Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

Signs and symptoms may include: Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it\\'s causing physical, social or interpersonal problems Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies Using alcohol in situations where it\\'s not safe, such as when driving or swimming Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don\\'t drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms Alcohol use disorder can include periods of alcohol intoxication and symptoms of withdrawal. Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more impaired you become. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, impaired judgment, slurred speech, impaired attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called \"blackouts,\" where you don\\'t remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma or even death. Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to four or five days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations. What is considered 1 drink? The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these: 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5 percent alcohol) 8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7 percent alcohol) 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of unfortified wine (about 12 percent alcohol) 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of 80-proof hard liquor (about 40 percent alcohol) When to see a doctor If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or your drinking is causing problems, or your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your doctor. Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health professional or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group. Because denial is common, you may not feel like you have a problem with drinking. You might not recognize how much you drink or how many problems in your life are related to alcohol use. Listen to relatives, friends or co-workers when they ask you to examine your drinking habits or to seek help. Consider talking with someone who has had a problem drinking, but has stopped. If your loved one needs help Many people with alcohol use disorder hesitate to get treatment because they don\\'t recognize they have a problem. An intervention from loved ones can help some people recognize and accept that they need professional help. If you\\'re concerned about someone who drinks too much, ask a professional experienced in alcohol treatment for advice on how to approach that person. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

Because early cervical cancer doesn't cause symptoms, it's vital that women have regular screening tests to detect any precancerous changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. Current guidelines recommend that women ages 21 to 29 have a Pap test every three years. Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to continue having a Pap test every three years, or every five years if they also get the HPV DNA test at the same time. Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three normal Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no abnormal results.

Talk to your doctor about any change in the color or size of a mole or if itching, pain, bleeding or inflammation develops. Melanoma Melanoma Melanoma The first sign of melanoma is often a mole that changes size, shape or color. This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera).

Moles are usually less than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth (congenital nevi) can be bigger than usual, covering part of the face, torso or a limb. Moles can develop anywhere on your body, including your scalp, armpits, under your nails, and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 40 moles. Many of these develop by age 50. Moles may change or fade away over time. With hormonal changes in adolescence and pregnancy, they may become darker and larger. Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are sometimes called flesh moles, but they are actually dermatoses papulosa nigra — a type of seborrheic keratosis, not clusters of pigment-forming cells (nevi). Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. Flesh moles don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated if you consider them a cosmetic concern. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma A mole may be a sign of skin cancer if it has irregular borders or an asymmetrical shape or if it changes in color, shape, size or height. This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for: A is for asymmetrical shape. One half is unlike the other half. B is for border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders. C is for color. Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above. Others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.

Anorexia also includes emotional and behavioral issues involving an unrealistic perception of body weight and an extremely strong fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. It may be difficult to notice signs and symptoms because what is considered a low body weight is different for each person, and some individuals may not appear extremely thin. Also, people with anorexia often disguise their thinness, eating habits or physical problems. Physical symptoms Physical signs and symptoms of anorexia may include: Extreme weight loss or not making expected developmental weight gains Thin appearance Abnormal blood counts Fatigue Insomnia Dizziness or fainting Bluish discoloration of the fingers Hair that thins, breaks or falls out Soft, downy hair covering the body Absence of menstruation Constipation and abdominal pain Dry or yellowish skin Intolerance of cold Irregular heart rhythms Low blood pressure Dehydration Swelling of arms or legs Eroded teeth and calluses on the knuckles from induced vomiting Some people who have anorexia binge and purge, similar to individuals who have bulimia. But people with anorexia generally struggle with an abnormally low body weight, while individuals with bulimia typically are normal to above normal weight. Emotional and behavioral symptoms Behavioral symptoms of anorexia may include attempts to lose weight by: Severely restricting food intake through dieting or fasting Exercising excessively Bingeing and self-induced vomiting to get rid of food, which may include the use of laxatives, enemas, diet aids or herbal products Emotional and behavioral signs and symptoms may include: Preoccupation with food, which sometimes includes cooking elaborate meals for others but not eating them Frequently skipping meals or refusing to eat Denial of hunger or making excuses for not eating Eating only a few certain \"safe\" foods, usually those low in fat and calories Adopting rigid meal or eating rituals, such as spitting food out after chewing Not wanting to eat in public Lying about how much food has been eaten Fear of gaining weight that may include repeated weighing or measuring the body Frequent checking in the mirror for perceived flaws Complaining about being fat or having parts of the body that are fat Covering up in layers of clothing Flat mood (lack of emotion) Social withdrawal Irritability Insomnia Reduced interest in sex When to see a doctor Unfortunately, many people with anorexia don\\'t want treatment, at least initially.

People with this disorder may experience personality changes or mood disturbances, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness. Encephalomyelitis. This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There may be a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the area affected. Opsoclonus-myoclonus. This syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections. It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements (opsoclonus) and involuntary, chaotic muscle jerks (myoclonus) in your limbs and trunk. Stiff person syndrome. Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome is characterized by progressive, severe muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly affecting your spine and legs. It may also cause painful muscle spasms. Myelopathy. This term refers to a syndrome of injury limited to the spinal cord. Depending on the level of spinal cord injury, you may have changes in bowel and bladder function, and severe weakness and numbness up to a certain level in your body. If the level of injury includes your neck, you can have severe disability affecting all four limbs. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. This is a syndrome caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. Signs and symptoms include pelvic and lower extremity muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. Autonomic nervous system problems can include dry mouth and impotence. When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer. Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is also related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles and also characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control, including muscles in your face, eyes, arms and legs. The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well. When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland (thymoma). Neuromyotonia. Neuromyotonia — also known as Isaacs\\' syndrome — is characterized by abnormal impulses in nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerve hyperexcitability) that control muscle movement. These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a \"bag of worms,\" progressive stiffness, muscle cramps, slowed movement and other muscle impairments. Peripheral neuropathy. This condition refers to patterns of damage to nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of your body. When damage involves only the sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system, you can have pain and disturbances in sensation anywhere in your body. Dysautonomia. Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of signs and symptoms resulting from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions (autonomic nervous system), such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. When this part of the nervous system is affected, common symptoms are low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing. When to see a doctor The signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are similar to those of many conditions, including cancer, cancer complications and even some cancer treatments. But if you have any signs or symptoms suggesting a paraneoplastic syndrome, see your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and appropriate care can be extremely important.

If you feel like your heart is beating too fast, make an appointment to see a health care provider. Seek immediate medical help if you have shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or near fainting, and chest pain or discomfort. A type of tachycardia called ventricular fibrillation can cause blood pressure to drop dramatically. Collapse can occur within seconds. Soon the affected person's breathing and pulse will stop. If this occurs, do the following: Call 911 or the emergency number in your area. If you or someone nearby is well trained in CPR, start CPR. CPR can help maintain blood flow to the organs until an electrical shock (defibrillation) can be given. If you're not trained in CPR or worried about giving rescue breaths, then provide hands-only CPR. Push hard and fast on the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute until paramedics arrive. You don't need to do rescue breathing. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available nearby, have someone get the device for you, and then follow the instructions.

       "  'symptoms': \"The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they'll become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. These can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected An abnormal feeling or disappearing fontanel on your baby's skull Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures Slow or no growth of the head as your baby grows Types of craniosynostosis There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Most cases of multiple suture craniosynostosis are linked to genetic syndromes and are called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. Sagittal craniosynostosis results in a head shape called scaphocephaly and is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of your baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side. Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time on one side of his or her head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more normal appearance.

Unlike some forms of migraine, tension-type headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances, nausea or vomiting. Although physical activity typically aggravates migraine pain, it doesn't make tension-type headache pain worse. An increased sensitivity to either light or sound can occur with a tension-type headache, but this symptom isn't common. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor If tension-type headaches disrupt your life or you need to take medication for your headaches more than twice a week, see your doctor. Even if you have a history of headaches, see your doctor if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different. Occasionally, headaches may indicate a serious medical condition, such as a brain tumor or rupture of a weakened blood vessel (aneurysm). When to seek emergency help If you have any of these signs or symptoms, seek emergency care: Abrupt, severe headache Headache with a fever, stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness or speaking difficulties Headache after a head injury, especially if the headache gets worse Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

       "  'symptoms': 'Symptoms of spinal AVM vary greatly from person to person depending on the severity and location of the AVM. Some people may not develop noticeable symptoms for many years, if at all. Others may experience symptoms that are debilitating or life-threatening. Symptoms usually develop when people are in their 20s, although almost 20% of people diagnosed with spinal AVM are under the age of 16. The emergence of symptoms may be sudden or gradual. Symptoms typically include: Problems with walking or climbing stairs Numbness, tingling or sudden pain in your legs Weakness on one or both sides of your body As the condition progresses, additional symptoms may include: Sudden, severe back pain Lack of feeling in the legs Difficulty urinating or moving your bowels Headache Stiff neck Sensitivity to light When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience signs and symptoms of spinal arteriovenous malformation.

       "  'symptoms': \"Gross hematuria produces pink, red or cola-colored urine due to the presence of red blood cells. It takes little blood to produce red urine, and the bleeding usually isn't painful. Passing blood clots in your urine, however, can be painful. Bloody urine often occurs without other signs or symptoms. When to see a doctor Make an appointment to see your doctor anytime you notice blood in your urine. Some medications, such as the laxative Ex-lax, and certain foods, including beets, rhubarb and berries, can cause your urine to turn red. A change in urine color caused by drugs, food or exercise might go away within a few days. Bloody urine looks different, but you might not be able to tell the difference. It's best to see your doctor anytime you see red-colored urine. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"}]"
