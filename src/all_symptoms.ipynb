       " {'illness': 'Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Sometimes it's difficult to recognize the difference between a strong-willed or emotional child and one with oppositional defiant disorder. It's normal to exhibit oppositional behavior at certain stages of a child's development. Signs of ODD generally begin during preschool years. Sometimes ODD may develop later, but almost always before the early teen years. These behaviors cause significant impairment with family, social activities, school and work. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, lists criteria for diagnosing ODD. The DSM-5 criteria include emotional and behavioral symptoms that last at least six months. Angry and irritable mood: Often and easily loses temper Is frequently touchy and easily annoyed by others Is often angry and resentful Argumentative and defiant behavior: Often argues with adults or people in authority Often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or rules Often deliberately annoys or upsets people Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior Vindictiveness: Is often spiteful or vindictive Has shown spiteful or vindictive behavior at least twice in the past six months ODD can vary in severity: Mild. Symptoms occur only in one setting, such as only at home, school, work or with peers. Moderate. Some symptoms occur in at least two settings. Severe. Some symptoms occur in three or more settings. For some children, symptoms may first be seen only at home, but with time extend to other settings, such as school and with friends. When to see a doctor Your child isn't likely to see his or her behavior as a problem. Instead, he or she will probably complain about unreasonable demands or blame others for problems. If your child shows signs that may indicate ODD or other disruptive behavior, or you're concerned about your ability to parent a challenging child, seek help from a child psychologist or a child psychiatrist with expertise in disruptive behavior problems. Ask your primary care doctor or your child's pediatrician to refer you to the appropriate professional. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

       " {'illness': 'Dwarfism',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms — other than short stature — vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders. Disproportionate dwarfism Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body. Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus). The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following: An average-size trunk Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers Limited mobility at the elbows A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose Progressive development of bowed legs Progressive development of swayed lower back An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm) Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include: A very short trunk A short neck Shortened arms and legs Average-size hands and feet Broad, rounded chest Slightly flattened cheekbones Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward A foot that's twisted or out of shape Instability of the neck bones Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine Progressive development of swayed lower back Vision and hearing problems Arthritis and problems with joint movement Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm) Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems. Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include: Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts Growth rate slower than expected for age Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism are often present at birth or in early infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not be immediately apparent. See your child's doctor if you have any concerns about your child's growth or overall development.

       "  'symptoms': \"Schizoaffective disorder symptoms may vary from person to person. People with the condition experience psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, as well as symptoms of a mood disorder — either bipolar type (episodes of mania and sometimes depression) or depressive type (episodes of depression). Although the development and course of schizoaffective disorder may vary, defining features include a major mood episode (depressed or manic mood) and at least a two-week period of psychotic symptoms when a major mood episode is not present. Signs and symptoms of schizoaffective disorder depend on the type — bipolar or depressive type — and may include, among others: Delusions — having false, fixed beliefs, despite evidence to the contrary Hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that aren't there Impaired communication and speech, such as being incoherent Bizarre or unusual behavior Symptoms of depression, such as feeling empty, sad or worthless Periods of manic mood, with an increase in energy and a decreased need for sleep over several days, and behaviors that are out of character Impaired occupational, academic and social functioning Problems with managing personal care, including cleanliness and physical appearance When to see a doctor If you think someone you know may have schizoaffective disorder symptoms, talk to that person about your concerns. Although you can't force someone to seek professional help, you can offer encouragement and support and help find a qualified doctor or mental health professional. If your loved one can't provide his or her own food, clothing or shelter, or if the safety of your loved one or others is a concern, you may need to call 911 or other emergency responders for help so that your loved one can be evaluated by a mental health professional. Suicidal thoughts or behavior Talk of suicide or suicidal behavior may occur in someone with schizoaffective disorder. If you have a loved one who is in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

Expressive aphasia. This is also called Broca\\'s or nonfluent aphasia. People with this pattern of aphasia may understand what other people say better than they can speak. People with this pattern of aphasia struggle to get words out, speak in very short sentences and omit words. A person might say, \"Want food\" or \"Walk park today.\" A listener can usually understand the meaning, but people with this aphasia pattern are often aware of their difficulty communicating and may get frustrated. They may also have right-sided paralysis or weakness. Comprehensive aphasia. People with this pattern of aphasia (also called fluent or Wernicke\\'s aphasia) may speak easily and fluently in long, complex sentences that don\\'t make sense or include unrecognizable, incorrect or unnecessary words. They usually don\\'t understand spoken language well and often don\\'t realize that others can\\'t understand them. Global aphasia. This aphasia pattern is characterized by poor comprehension and difficulty forming words and sentences. Global aphasia results from extensive damage to the brain\\'s language networks. People with global aphasia have severe disabilities with expression and comprehension. When to see a doctor Because aphasia is often a sign of a serious problem, such as a stroke, seek emergency medical care if you suddenly develop: Difficulty speaking Trouble understanding speech Difficulty with word recall Problems with reading or writing Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

       "  'symptoms': \"The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. Primary infection (Acute HIV) Some people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within two to four weeks after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat and painful mouth sores Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck Diarrhea Weight loss Cough Night sweats These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In this stage of infection, HIV is still present in the body and in white blood cells. However, many people may not have any symptoms or infections during this time. This stage can last for many years if you're not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Pneumonia Progression to AIDS Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years. When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers — diseases that wouldn't usually cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include: Sweats Chills Recurring fever Chronic diarrhea Swollen lymph glands Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth Persistent, unexplained fatigue Weakness Weight loss Skin rashes or bumps When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a doctor as soon as possible.

       "  'symptoms': \"Normally when you blink, your eyelids distribute tears evenly across your eyes, keeping the surfaces of the eyes lubricated. These tears drain into small openings on the inner part of your eyelids (puncta). If you have ectropion, your lower lid pulls away from your eye and tears don't drain properly into the puncta. The resulting signs and symptoms can include: Watery eyes (excessive tearing). Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids. Excessive dryness. Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy. Irritation. Stagnant tears or dryness can irritate your eyes, causing a burning sensation and redness in your eyelids and the whites of your eyes. Sensitivity to light. Stagnant tears or dry eyes can irritate the surface of the cornea, making you sensitive to light. When to see a doctor See your doctor if your eyes are constantly watering or irritated, or your eyelid seems to be sagging or drooping. Seek immediate care if you have been diagnosed with ectropion and you experience: Rapidly increasing redness in your eyes Sensitivity to light Decreasing vision These are signs and symptoms of cornea exposure or ulcers, which can harm your vision.

       " {'illness': 'Epilepsy',\n",
       "  'symptoms': 'Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion A staring spell Stiff muscles Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs Loss of consciousness or awareness Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they\\'re called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don\\'t cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. Some people experience deja vu. This type of seizure may also result in involuntary jerking of one body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream. During a focal seizure with impaired awareness, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, typically occur in children. They\\'re characterized by staring into space with or without subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking and only last between 5-10 seconds. These seizures may occur in clusters, happening as often as 100 times per day, and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiff muscles and may affect consciousness. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. Since this most often affects the legs, it often causes you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches and usually affect the upper body, arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking. They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn\\'t return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You\\'re pregnant. You have diabetes. You\\'ve injured yourself during the seizure. You continue to have seizures even though you\\'ve been taking anti-seizure medication. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. @font-face {\\n\\t\\t\\tfont-family: mayo-form-icons;\\n\\t\\t\\tsrc:

       "  'symptoms': 'Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others: Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug Spending money on the drug, even though you can\\'t afford it Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it\\'s causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn\\'t do, such as stealing Driving or doing other risky activities when you\\'re under the influence of the drug Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug Recognizing unhealthy drug use in family members Sometimes it\\'s difficult to distinguish normal teenage moodiness or angst from signs of drug use. Possible indications that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include: Problems at school or work — frequently missing school or work, a sudden disinterest in school activities or work, or a drop in grades or work performance Physical health issues — lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes Neglected appearance — lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks Changes in behavior — exaggerated efforts to bar family members from entering his or her room or being secretive about where he or she goes with friends; or drastic changes in behavior and in relationships with family and friends Money issues — sudden requests for money without a reasonable explanation; or your discovery that money is missing or has been stolen or that items have disappeared from your home, indicating maybe they\\'re being sold to support drug use Recognizing signs of drug use or intoxication Signs and symptoms of drug use or intoxication may vary, depending on the type of drug. Below you\\'ll find several examples. Marijuana, hashish and other cannabis-containing substances People use cannabis by smoking, eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. Cannabis often precedes or is used along with other substances, such as alcohol or illegal drugs, and is often the first drug tried. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\" A heightened sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Increased blood pressure and heart rate Red eyes Dry mouth Decreased coordination Difficulty concentrating or remembering Slowed reaction time Anxiety or paranoid thinking Cannabis odor on clothes or yellow fingertips Exaggerated cravings for certain foods at unusual times Long-term (chronic) use is often associated with: Decreased mental sharpness Poor performance at school or at work Reduced number of friends and interests K2, Spice and bath salts Two groups of synthetic drugs — synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones — are illegal in most states. The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable, as there is no quality control and some ingredients may not be known. Synthetic cannabinoids, also called K2 or Spice, are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked, but can be prepared as an herbal tea. Despite manufacturer claims, these are chemical compounds rather than \"natural\" or harmless products. These drugs can produce a \"high\" similar to marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\" Elevated mood An altered sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Extreme anxiety or agitation Paranoia Hallucinations Increased heart rate and blood pressure or heart attack Vomiting Confusion Substituted cathinones, also called \"bath salts,\" are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection. Despite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted, inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in dangerous health effects or even death. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Euphoria Increased sociability Increased energy and agitation Increased sex drive Increased heart rate and blood pressure Problems thinking clearly Loss of muscle control Paranoia Panic attacks Hallucinations Delirium Psychotic and violent behavior Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. They\\'re often used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to \"switch off\" or forget stress-related thoughts or feelings. Barbiturates. Examples include phenobarbital and secobarbital (Seconal). Benzodiazepines. Examples include sedatives, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), clonazepam (Klonopin) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Hypnotics. Examples include prescription sleeping medications such as zolpidem (Ambien, Intermezzo, others) and zaleplon (Sonata). Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Drowsiness Slurred speech Lack of coordination Irritability or changes in mood Problems concentrating or thinking clearly Memory problems Involuntary eye movements Lack of inhibition Slowed breathing and reduced blood pressure Falls or accidents Dizziness Meth, cocaine and other stimulants Stimulants include amphetamines, meth (methamphetamine), cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others) and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Adderall XR, others). They are often used and misused in search of a \"high,\" or to boost energy, to improve performance at work or school, or to lose weight or control appetite. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Feeling of exhilaration and excess confidence Increased alertness Increased energy and restlessness Behavior changes or aggression Rapid or rambling speech Dilated pupils Confusion, delusions and hallucinations Irritability, anxiety or paranoia Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature Nausea or vomiting with weight loss Impaired judgment Nasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose (if snorting drugs) Mouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs (\"meth mouth\") Insomnia Depression as the drug wears off Club drugs Club drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties. Examples include ecstasy or molly (MDMA), gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), flunitrazepam (Rohypnol ― a brand used outside the U.S. ― also called roofie) and ketamine. These drugs are not all in the same category, but they share some similar effects and dangers, including long-term harmful effects. Because GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation, muscle relaxation, confusion and memory loss, the potential for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs. Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include: Hallucinations Paranoia Dilated pupils Chills and sweating Involuntary shaking (tremors) Behavior changes Muscle cramping and teeth clenching Muscle relaxation, poor coordination or problems moving Reduced inhibitions Heightened or altered sense of sight, sound and taste Poor judgment Memory problems or loss of memory Reduced consciousness Increased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure Hallucinogens Use of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug. The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP). LSD use may cause: Hallucinations Greatly reduced perception of reality, for example, interpreting input from one of your senses as another, such as hearing colors Impulsive behavior Rapid shifts in emotions Permanent mental changes in perception Rapid heart rate and high blood pressure Tremors Flashbacks, a re-experience of the hallucinations — even years later PCP use may cause: A feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings Hallucinations Problems with coordination and movement Aggressive, possibly violent behavior Involuntary eye movements Lack of pain sensation Increase in blood pressure and heart rate Problems with thinking and memory Problems speaking Impaired judgment Intolerance to loud noise Sometimes seizures or coma Inhalants Signs and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance. Some commonly inhaled substances include glue, paint thinners, correction fluid, felt tip marker fluid, gasoline, cleaning fluids and household aerosol products. Due to the toxic nature of these substances, users may develop brain damage or sudden death. Signs and symptoms of use can include: Possessing an inhalant substance without a reasonable explanation Brief euphoria or intoxication Decreased inhibition Combativeness or belligerence Dizziness Nausea or vomiting Involuntary eye movements Appearing intoxicated with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination Irregular heartbeats Tremors Lingering odor of inhalant material Rash around the nose and mouth Opioid painkillers Opioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. This class of drugs includes, among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone and oxycodone. Sometimes called the \"opioid epidemic,\" addiction to opioid prescription pain medications has reached an alarming rate across the United States. Some people who\\'ve been using opioids over a long period of time may need physician-prescribed temporary or long-term drug substitution during treatment. Signs and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include: Reduced sense of pain Agitation, drowsiness or sedation Slurred speech Problems with attention and memory Constricted pupils Lack of awareness or inattention to surrounding people and things Problems with coordination Depression Confusion Constipation Runny nose or nose sores (if snorting drugs) Needle marks (if injecting drugs) When to see a doctor If your drug use is out of control or causing problems, get help. The sooner you seek help, the greater your chances for a long-term recovery. Talk with your primary doctor or see a mental health professional, such as a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry, or a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Make an appointment to see a doctor if: You can\\'t stop using a drug You continue using the drug despite the harm it causes Your drug use has led to unsafe behavior, such as sharing needles or unprotected sex You think you may be having withdrawal symptoms after stopping drug use If you\\'re not ready to approach a doctor, help lines or hotlines may be a good place to learn about treatment. You can find these lines listed on the internet or in the phone book. When to seek emergency help Seek emergency help if you or someone you know has taken a drug and: May have overdosed Shows changes in consciousness Has trouble breathing Has seizures or convulsions Has signs of a possible heart attack, such as chest pain or pressure Has any other troublesome physical or psychological reaction to use of the drug Staging an intervention People struggling with addiction usually deny that their drug use is problematic and are reluctant to seek treatment. An intervention presents a loved one with a structured opportunity to make changes before things get even worse and can motivate someone to seek or accept help. An intervention should be carefully planned and may be done by family and friends in consultation with a doctor or professional such as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor, or directed by an intervention professional. It involves family and friends and sometimes co-workers, clergy or others who care about the person struggling with addiction. During the intervention, these people gather together to have a direct, heart-to-heart conversation with the person about the consequences of addiction and ask him or her to accept treatment.

The cause of this condition is unknown, but it primarily affects older women. Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include: Gradual thinning on top of head. This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead.

Circular or patchy bald spots. Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. Sudden loosening of hair. A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary. Full-body hair loss. Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back. Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you are distressed by persistent hair loss in you or your child and want to pursue treatment. For women who are experiencing a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia), talk with your doctor about early treatment to avoid significant permanent baldness.

       " {'illness': 'Childhood apraxia of speech',\n",
       "  'symptoms': 'Children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) may have many speech symptoms or characteristics that vary depending on their age and the severity of their speech problems. CAS can be associated with: Delayed onset of first words A limited number of spoken words The ability to form only a few consonant or vowel sounds These symptoms are usually noticed between ages 18 months and 2 years, and may indicate suspected CAS. As children produce more speech, usually between ages 2 and 4, characteristics that likely indicate CAS include: Vowel and consonant distortions Separation of syllables in or between words Voicing errors, such as \"pie\" sounding like \"bye\" Many children with CAS have difficulty getting their jaws, lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound, and they may have difficulty moving smoothly to the next sound. Many children with CAS also have language problems, such as reduced vocabulary or difficulty with word order. Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS and can be helpful to diagnose the problem. However, some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. It\\'s difficult to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other types of speech or language disorders. Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. Those particularly associated with CAS include: Difficulty moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another Groping movements with the jaw, lips or tongue to make the correct movement for speech sounds Vowel distortions, such as attempting to use the correct vowel, but saying it incorrectly Using the wrong stress in a word, such as pronouncing \"banana\" as \"BUH-nan-uh\" instead of \"buh-NAN-uh\" Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying \"BUH-NAN-UH\" Separation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables Inconsistency, such as making different errors when trying to say the same word a second time Difficulty imitating simple words Inconsistent voicing errors, such as saying \"down\" instead of \"town\" Other characteristics are seen in most children with speech or language problems and aren\\'t helpful in distinguishing CAS. Characteristics seen both in children with CAS and in children with other types of speech or language disorders include: Babbling less or making fewer vocal sounds than is typical between the ages of 7 to 12 months old Speaking first words late (after ages 12 to 18 months old) Using a limited number of consonants and vowels Frequently leaving out (omitting) sounds Using speech that is difficult to understand speech Other speech disorders sometimes confused with CAS Some speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the characteristics may overlap. These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders, phonological disorders and dysarthria. A child who has trouble learning how to make specific sounds, but doesn\\'t have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak, may have an articulation or phonological disorder. Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS. Articulation or phonological speech errors may include: Substituting sounds, such as saying \"fum\" instead of \"thumb,\" \"wabbit\" instead of \"rabbit\" or \"tup\" instead of \"cup\" Leaving out (omitting) final consonants, such as saying \"duh\" instead of \"duck\" or \"uh\" instead of \"up\" Stopping the airstream, such as saying \"tun\" instead of \"sun\" or \"doo\" instead of \"zoo\" Simplifying sound combinations, such as saying \"ting\" instead of \"string\" or \"fog\" instead of \"frog\" Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that is due to weakness, spasticity or inability to control the speech muscles. Making speech sounds is difficult because the speech muscles can\\'t move as far, as quickly or as strongly as normal. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice, or slurred or slow speech. Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. However, when dysarthria is caused by damage to certain areas of the brain that affect coordination, it can be difficult to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria.

Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example: If you have atherosclerosis in your heart arteries, you may have symptoms, such as chest pain or pressure (angina). If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your brain, you may have signs and symptoms such as sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These signal a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which, if left untreated, may progress to a stroke. If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have signs or symptoms of peripheral artery disease, such as leg pain when walking (claudication) or decreased blood pressure in an affected limb.

If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk. Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor. Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help. Take aspirin, if recommended. Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don't take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first. What to do if you see someone who might be having a heart attack If you see someone who's unconscious and you believe is having a heart attack, first call for emergency medical help. Then check if the person is breathing and has a pulse. If the person isn't breathing or you don't find a pulse, only then should you begin CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm — about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. If you haven't been trained in CPR, doctors recommend performing only chest compressions. If you have been trained in CPR, you can go on to opening the airway and rescue breathing. More Information Heart attack symptoms Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

Even covered areas can burn if, for example, your clothing has a loose weave that allows ultraviolet (UV) light through. Your eyes, which are extremely sensitive to the sun's UV light, also can burn. Sunburn signs and symptoms usually appear within a few hours after sun exposure. But it may take a day or more to know how severe the sunburn is. Within a few days, your body may start to heal itself by peeling the damaged skin's top layer. After peeling, your skin may temporarily have an irregular color and pattern. A bad sunburn may take several days to heal.

The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several feet away (projectile vomiting). Vomiting might be mild at first and gradually become more severe as the pylorus opening narrows. The vomit may sometimes contain blood. Persistent hunger. Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting. Stomach contractions. You may notice wavelike contractions (peristalsis) that ripple across your baby's upper abdomen soon after feeding but before vomiting. This is caused by stomach muscles trying to force food through the narrowed pylorus. Dehydration. Your baby might cry without tears or become lethargic. You might find yourself changing fewer wet diapers or diapers that aren't as wet as you expect. Changes in bowel movements. Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated. Weight problems.

You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, but they take up a great deal of time and interfere with your daily routine and social, school or work functioning. Obsession symptoms OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things. Obsessions often have themes to them, such as: Fear of contamination or dirt Doubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty Needing things orderly and symmetrical Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include: Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way Images of driving your car into a crowd of people Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public Unpleasant sexual images Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands Compulsion symptoms OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety. You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix. As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as: Washing and cleaning Checking Counting Orderliness Following a strict routine Demanding reassurance Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include: Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked Checking the stove repeatedly to make sure it's off Counting in certain patterns Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase Arranging your canned goods to face the same way Severity varies OCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it can start in childhood. Symptoms usually begin gradually and tend to vary in severity throughout life. The types of obsessions and compulsions you experience can also change over time. Symptoms generally worsen when you experience greater stress. OCD, usually considered a lifelong disorder, can have mild to moderate symptoms or be so severe and time-consuming that it becomes disabling. When to see a doctor There's a difference between being a perfectionist — someone who requires flawless results or performance, for example — and having OCD. OCD thoughts aren't simply excessive worries about real problems in your life or liking to have things clean or arranged in a specific way.

Change in stool color. Blood can show up as red streaks in your stool or make stool appear black. A change in color may also be caused by certain foods, medications or dietary supplements.

However, a number of other conditions also can cause changes in bowel habits. Pain. A large colon polyp can partially obstruct your bowel, leading to crampy abdominal pain. Iron deficiency anemia. Bleeding from polyps can occur slowly over time, without visible blood in your stool. Chronic bleeding robs your body of the iron needed to produce the substance that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body (hemoglobin). The result is iron deficiency anemia, which can make you feel tired and short of breath.

Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may differ greatly from person to person and over the course of the disease depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms often affect movement, such as: Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your body at a time, or your legs and trunk Electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward (Lhermitte sign) Tremor, lack of coordination or unsteady gait Vision problems are also common, including: Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time, often with pain during eye movement Prolonged double vision Blurry vision Multiple sclerosis symptoms may also include: Slurred speech Fatigue Dizziness Tingling or pain in parts of your body Problems with sexual, bowel and bladder function When to see a doctor See a doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms for unknown reasons. Disease course Most people with MS have a relapsing-remitting disease course. They experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen signs and symptoms of MS, but these aren't considered true disease relapses. At least 50% of those with relapsing-remitting MS eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms, with or without periods of remission, within 10 to 20 years from disease onset. This is known as secondary-progressive MS. The worsening of symptoms usually includes problems with mobility and gait. The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary-progressive MS. Some people with MS experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses, known as primary-progressive MS.

       " {'illness': 'Multiple system atrophy (MSA)',\n",
       "  'symptoms': 'Multiple system atrophy (MSA) affects many parts of your body. Symptoms typically develop in adulthood, usually in the 50s or 60s. MSA is classified by two types: parkinsonian and cerebellar. The type depends on the symptoms you have at diagnosis. Parkinsonian type This is the most common type of MSA. The signs and symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson\\'s disease, such as: Rigid muscles Difficulty bending your arms and legs Slow movement (bradykinesia) Tremors (rare in MSA compared with classic Parkinson\\'s disease) Problems with posture and balance Cerebellar type The main signs and symptoms are problems with muscle coordination (ataxia), but others may include: Impaired movement and coordination, such as unsteady gait and loss of balance Slurred, slow or low-volume speech (dysarthria) Visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision and difficulty focusing your eyes Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or chewing General signs and symptoms In addition, the primary sign of multiple system atrophy is: Postural (orthostatic) hypotension, a form of low blood pressure that makes you feel dizzy or lightheaded, or even faint, when you stand up from sitting or lying down You can also develop dangerously high blood pressure levels while lying down (supine hypertension). MSA might cause other difficulties with involuntary (autonomic) body functions, including: Urinary and bowel dysfunction Constipation Loss of bladder or bowel control (incontinence) Sweating abnormalities Reduced production of sweat, tears and saliva Heat intolerance due to reduced sweating Impaired body temperature control, often causing cold hands or feet Sleep disorders Agitated sleep due to \"acting out\" dreams Abnormal breathing at night Sexual dysfunction Inability to achieve or maintain an erection (impotence) Loss of libido Cardiovascular problems Color changes in hands and feet caused by pooling of blood Cold hands and feet Psychiatric problems Difficulty controlling emotions, such as laughing or crying inappropriately When to see a doctor If you develop any of the signs and symptoms associated with multiple system atrophy, see your doctor for an evaluation and diagnosis. If you\\'ve already been diagnosed with the condition, contact your doctor if new symptoms occur or if existing symptoms worsen. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

       " {'illness': 'Specific phobias',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"A specific phobia involves an intense, persistent fear of a specific object or situation that's out of proportion to the actual risk. There are many types of phobias, and it's not unusual to experience a specific phobia about more than one object or situation. Specific phobias can also occur along with other types of anxiety disorders. Common categories of specific phobias are a fear of: Situations, such as airplanes, enclosed spaces or going to school Nature, such as thunderstorms or heights Animals or insects, such as dogs or spiders Blood, injection or injury, such as needles, accidents or medical procedures Others, such as choking, vomiting, loud noises or clowns Each specific phobia is referred to by its own term. Examples of more common terms include acrophobia for the fear of heights and claustrophobia for the fear of confined spaces. No matter what specific phobia you have, it's likely to produce these types of reactions: An immediate feeling of intense fear, anxiety and panic when exposed to or even thinking about the source of your fear Awareness that your fears are unreasonable or exaggerated but feeling powerless to control them Worsening anxiety as the situation or object gets closer to you in time or physical proximity Doing everything possible to avoid the object or situation or enduring it with intense anxiety or fear Difficulty functioning normally because of your fear Physical reactions and sensations, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or difficulty breathing Feeling nauseated, dizzy or fainting around blood or injuries In children, possibly tantrums, clinging, crying, or refusing to leave a parent's side or approach their fear When to see a doctor An unreasonable fear can be an annoyance — having to take the stairs instead of an elevator or driving the long way to work instead of taking the freeway, for instance — but it isn't considered a specific phobia unless it seriously disrupts your life. If anxiety negatively affects functioning in work, school or social situations, talk with your doctor or a mental health professional. Childhood fears, such as fear of the dark, of monsters or of being left alone, are common, and most children outgrow them. But if your child has a persistent, excessive fear that interferes with daily functioning at home or school, talk to your child's doctor. Most people can be helped with the right therapy. And therapy tends to be easier when the phobia is addressed right away rather than waiting. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

       "  'symptoms': \"There are four common routes of anthrax infection, each with different signs and symptoms. In most cases, symptoms develop within six days of exposure to the bacteria. However, it's possible for inhalation anthrax symptoms to take more than six weeks to appear. Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax You can contract anthrax when spores penetrate your skin, usually through an open wound. The infection begins as a raised, sometimes itchy, bump resembling an insect bite. But within a day or two, the bump develops into an open, usually painless sore with a black center. A skin-related (cutaneous) anthrax infection enters your body through your skin, usually through a cut or other sore. It's by far the most common route of the disease. It's also the mildest. With appropriate treatment, cutaneous anthrax is seldom fatal. Signs and symptoms include: A raised, itchy bump resembling an insect bite that quickly develops into a painless sore with a black center Swelling in the sore and nearby lymph glands Sometimes, flu-like symptoms including fever and headache Gastrointestinal anthrax A gastrointestinal anthrax infection results from eating undercooked meat from an infected animal. It can affect your gastrointestinal tract from your throat to your colon. Signs and symptoms include: Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Headache Loss of appetite Fever Severe, bloody diarrhea in the later stages of the disease Sore throat and difficulty swallowing Swollen neck Inhalation anthrax Inhalation anthrax Inhalation anthrax Inhalation anthrax This illustration shows how the spores that cause inhalation anthrax — the most deadly form of anthrax infection — enter and affect the body. Inhalation anthrax develops when you breathe in anthrax spores. It's the most deadly form of the disease, and is often fatal, even with treatment. Initial signs and symptoms include: Flu-like symptoms for a few hours or days, such as sore throat, mild fever, fatigue and muscle aches Mild chest discomfort Shortness of breath Nausea Coughing up blood Painful swallowing High fever Trouble breathing Shock — an acute medical condition involving collapse of the circulatory system Meningitis Injection anthrax This recently identified route of anthrax infection has so far been reported only in Europe. It's contracted through injecting illegal drugs. Initial signs and symptoms include: Redness at the area of injection (without an area that changes to black) Significant swelling Shock Multiple organ failure Meningitis When to see a doctor Many common illnesses start with symptoms that resemble the flu. The chances that your sore throat and aching muscles are due to anthrax are extremely small. If you think you may have been exposed — for example, if you work in an environment where anthrax is likely to occur — see a doctor immediately for evaluation and care. If you develop signs and symptoms of the disorder after exposure to animals or animal products in parts of the world where anthrax is common, seek prompt medical attention. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

       " {'illness': 'Factitious disorder',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Factitious disorder symptoms involve mimicking or producing illness or injury or exaggerating symptoms or impairment to deceive others. People with the disorder go to great lengths to hide their deception, so it may be difficult to realize that their symptoms are actually part of a serious mental health disorder. They continue with the deception, even without receiving any visible benefit or reward or when faced with objective evidence that doesn't support their claims. Factitious disorder signs and symptoms may include: Clever and convincing medical or psychological problems Extensive knowledge of medical terms and diseases Vague or inconsistent symptoms Conditions that get worse for no apparent reason Conditions that don't respond as expected to standard therapies Seeking treatment from many different doctors or hospitals, which may include using a fake name Reluctance to allow doctors to talk to family or friends or to other health care professionals Frequent stays in the hospital Eagerness to have frequent testing or risky operations Many surgical scars or evidence of numerous procedures Having few visitors when hospitalized Arguing with doctors and staff Factious disorder imposed on another Factitious disorder imposed on another (previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy) is when someone falsely claims that another person has physical or psychological signs or symptoms of illness, or causes injury or disease in another person with the intention of deceiving others. People with this disorder present another person as sick, injured or having problems functioning, claiming that medical attention is needed. Usually this involves a parent harming a child. This form of abuse can put a child in serious danger of injury or unnecessary medical care. How those with factitious disorder fake illness Because people with factitious disorder become experts at faking symptoms and diseases or inflicting real injuries upon themselves, it may be hard for health care professionals and loved ones to know if illnesses are real or not. People with factitious disorder make up symptoms or cause illnesses in several ways, such as: Exaggerating existing symptoms. Even when an actual medical or psychological condition exists, they may exaggerate symptoms to appear sicker or more impaired than is true. Making up histories. They may give loved ones, health care professionals or support groups a false medical history, such as claiming to have had cancer or AIDS. Or they may falsify medical records to indicate an illness. Faking symptoms. They may fake symptoms, such as stomach pain, seizures or passing out. Causing self-harm. They may make themselves sick, for example, by injecting themselves with bacteria, milk, gasoline or feces. They may injure, cut or burn themselves. They may take medications, such as blood thinners or drugs for diabetes, to mimic diseases. They may also interfere with wound healing, such as reopening or infecting cuts. Tampering. They may manipulate medical instruments to skew results, such as heating up thermometers. Or they may tamper with lab tests, such as contaminating their urine samples with blood or other substances. When to see a doctor People with factitious disorder may be well aware of the risk of injury or even death as a result of self-harm or the treatment they seek, but they can't control their behaviors and they're unlikely to seek help. Even when confronted with objective proof — such as a videotape — that they're causing their illness, they often deny it and refuse psychiatric help. If you think a loved one may be exaggerating or faking health problems, it may help to attempt a gentle conversation about your concerns. Try to avoid anger, judgment or confrontation. Also try to reinforce and encourage more healthy, productive activities rather than focusing on dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors. Offer support and caring and, if possible, help in finding treatment. If your loved one causes self-inflicted injury or attempts suicide, call 911 or emergency medical help or, if you can safely do so, take him or her to an emergency room immediately.

This form is called miliaria pustulosa. A less common form of heat rash (miliaria profunda) affects the dermis, a deeper layer of skin. Retained sweat leaks out of the sweat gland into the skin, causing firm, flesh-colored lesions that resemble goose bumps.

       "  'symptoms': 'Throughout the menopausal transition, some subtle — and some not-so-subtle — changes in your body may take place. You might experience: Irregular periods. As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you\\'re likely in late perimenopause. Hot flashes and sleep problems. Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them. Mood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause. Vaginal and bladder problems. When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence. Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you\\'re having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you\\'ve had no periods for 12 months. Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond. Loss of bone. With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones. Changing cholesterol levels. Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the \"good\" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease. When to see a doctor Some women seek medical attention for their perimenopausal symptoms. But others either tolerate the changes or simply don\\'t experience symptoms severe enough to need attention. Because symptoms may be subtle and come on gradually, you may not realize at first that they\\'re all connected to the same thing — hormone fluctuations of the menopausal transition.

Signs and symptoms of acute porphyria may include: Severe abdominal pain Pain in your chest, legs or back Constipation or diarrhea Nausea and vomiting Muscle pain, tingling, numbness, weakness or paralysis Red or brown urine Mental changes, such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, disorientation or paranoia Breathing problems Urination problems Rapid or irregular heartbeats you can feel (palpitations) High blood pressure Seizures Cutaneous porphyrias Cutaneous porphyrias include forms of the disease that cause skin symptoms as a result of sensitivity to sunlight, but these forms don't usually affect your nervous system. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of all the porphyrias. As a result of sun exposure, you may experience: Sensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain Sudden painful skin redness (erythema) and swelling (edema Blisters on exposed skin, usually the hands, arms and face Fragile thin skin with changes in skin color (pigment) Itching Excessive hair growth in affected areas Red or brown urine When to see a doctor Many signs and symptoms of porphyria are similar to those of other, more common conditions. This can make it difficult to know if you're having an attack of porphyria. If you have any of the above symptoms, seek medical attention. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",
       " {'illness': 'Somatic symptom disorder',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Symptoms of somatic symptom disorder may be: Specific sensations, such as pain or shortness of breath, or more general symptoms, such as fatigue or weakness Unrelated to any medical cause that can be identified, or related to a medical condition such as cancer or heart disease, but more significant than what's usually expected A single symptom, multiple symptoms or varying symptoms Mild, moderate or severe Pain is the most common symptom, but whatever your symptoms, you have excessive thoughts, feelings or behaviors related to those symptoms, which cause significant problems, make it difficult to function and sometimes can be disabling. These thoughts, feelings and behaviors can include: Constant worry about potential illness Viewing normal physical sensations as a sign of severe physical illness Fearing that symptoms are serious, even when there is no evidence Thinking that physical sensations are threatening or harmful Feeling that medical evaluation and treatment have not been adequate Fearing that physical activity may cause damage to your body Repeatedly checking your body for abnormalities Frequent health care visits that don't relieve your concerns or that make them worse Being unresponsive to medical treatment or unusually sensitive to medication side effects Having a more severe impairment than is usually expected from a medical condition For somatic symptom disorder, more important than the specific physical symptoms you experience is the way you interpret and react to the symptoms and how they impact your daily life. When to see a doctor Because physical symptoms can be related to medical problems, it's important to be evaluated by your primary care provider if you aren't sure what's causing your symptoms. If your primary care provider believes that you may have somatic symptom disorder, he or she can refer you to a mental health professional. Caring for a loved one When physical symptoms considered to be somatic symptom disorder occur, it can be difficult to accept that a life-threatening illness has been eliminated as the cause. Symptoms cause very real distress for the person and reassurance isn't always helpful. Encourage your loved one to consider the possibility of a mental health referral to learn ways to cope with the reaction to symptoms and any disability it causes. Physical disability may cause the person to be dependent and need extra physical care and emotional support that can exhaust caregivers and cause stress on families and relationships. If you feel overwhelmed by your role as caregiver, you may want to talk to a mental health professional to address your own needs. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",
       " {'illness': 'Jaw tumors and cysts',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include: Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment. Odontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes. Other types of cysts and tumors. These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others. When to see a doctor If you're concerned that you may have symptoms of a jaw tumor or cyst, talk with your primary care provider or dentist. Many times, jaw cysts and tumors do not have symptoms and are typically discovered on routine screening X-rays done for other reasons. If you are diagnosed with or suspected of having a jaw tumor or cyst, your primary care provider can refer you to a specialist for diagnosis and treatment.

       " {'illness': 'Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"The primary features of ADHD include inattention and hyperactive-impulsive behavior. ADHD symptoms start before age 12, and in some children, they're noticeable as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood. ADHD occurs more often in males than in females, and behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive. There are three subtypes of ADHD : Predominantly inattentive. The majority of symptoms fall under inattention. Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive. The majority of symptoms are hyperactive and impulsive. Combined. This is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. Inattention A child who shows a pattern of inattention may often: Fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork Have trouble staying focused in tasks or play Appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly Have difficulty following through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork or chores Have trouble organizing tasks and activities Avoid or dislike tasks that require focused mental effort, such as homework Lose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils Be easily distracted Forget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores Hyperactivity and impulsivity A child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often: Fidget with or tap his or her hands or feet, or squirm in the seat Have difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situations Be on the go, in constant motion Run around or climb in situations when it's not appropriate Have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly Talk too much Blurt out answers, interrupting the questioner Have difficulty waiting for his or her turn Interrupt or intrude on others' conversations, games or activities Typical developmental behavior vs. ADHD Most healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It's typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and be unable to stick with one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest. The same is true of hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic — they often are still full of energy long after they've worn their parents out. In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings. Children who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends are likely struggling with something other than ADHD. The same is true of children who are hyperactive or inattentive at home, but whose schoolwork and friendships remain unaffected. When to see a doctor If you're concerned that your child shows signs of ADHD, see your pediatrician or family doctor. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, psychiatrist or pediatric neurologist, but it's important to have a medical evaluation first to check for other possible causes of your child's difficulties.

The main symptom is memory loss that\\'s more severe than normal forgetfulness and that can\\'t be explained by a medical condition. You can\\'t recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic time. Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat, or more rarely, can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. It may sometimes involve travel or confused wandering away from your life (dissociative fugue). An episode of amnesia usually occurs suddenly and may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years. Dissociative identity disorder. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by \"switching\" to alternate identities. You may feel the presence of two or more people talking or living inside your head, and you may feel as though you\\'re possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and characteristics, including obvious differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. People with dissociative identity disorder typically also have dissociative amnesia and often have dissociative fugue. Depersonalization-derealization disorder. This involves an ongoing or episodic sense of detachment or being outside yourself — observing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance as though watching a movie (depersonalization). Other people and things around you may feel detached and foggy or dreamlike, time may be slowed down or sped up, and the world may seem unreal (derealization). You may experience depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms, which can be profoundly distressing, may last only a few moments or come and go over many years. When to see a doctor Some people with dissociative disorders present in a crisis with traumatic flashbacks that are overwhelming or associated with unsafe behavior. People with these symptoms should be seen in an emergency room. If you or a loved one has less urgent symptoms that may indicate a dissociative disorder, call your doctor. Suicidal thoughts or behavior If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number — in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to reach a trained counselor.

A person with alcohol poisoning who is unconscious or can't be awakened is at risk of dying. Alcohol poisoning is an emergency If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning — even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms — seek immediate medical care. Here's what to do: Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning. Be prepared to provide information. If you know, be sure to tell hospital or emergency personnel the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when. Don't leave an unconscious person alone. Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may choke on his or her own vomit and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because he or she could choke. Help a person who is vomiting. Try to keep him or her sitting up. If the person must lie down, make sure to turn his or her head to the side — this helps prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake to prevent loss of consciousness. Don't be afraid to get help It can be difficult to decide if you think someone is drunk enough to warrant medical intervention, but it's best to err on the side of caution. You may worry about the consequences for yourself or your friend or loved one, particularly if you're underage. But the consequences of not getting the right help in time can be far more serious.

Most likely, you'll experience some irregularity in your periods before they end. Skipping periods during perimenopause is common and expected. Often, menstrual periods will skip a month and return, or skip several months and then start monthly cycles again for a few months. Periods also tend to happen on shorter cycles, so they are closer together. Despite irregular periods, pregnancy is possible. If you've skipped a period but aren't sure you've started the menopausal transition, consider a pregnancy test. When to see a doctor Keep up with regular visits with your doctor for preventive health care and any medical concerns. Continue getting these appointments during and after menopause.

Some symptoms appear more dominant or have a greater effect on functional ability, but that can change throughout the course of the disease. Movement disorders The movement disorders associated with Huntington's disease can include both involuntary movement problems and impairments in voluntary movements, such as: Involuntary jerking or writhing movements (chorea) Muscle problems, such as rigidity or muscle contracture (dystonia) Slow or abnormal eye movements Impaired gait, posture and balance Difficulty with speech or swallowing Impairments in voluntary movements — rather than the involuntary movements — may have a greater impact on a person's ability to work, perform daily activities, communicate and remain independent. Cognitive disorders Cognitive impairments often associated with Huntington's disease include: Difficulty organizing, prioritizing or focusing on tasks Lack of flexibility or the tendency to get stuck on a thought, behavior or action (perseveration) Lack of impulse control that can result in outbursts, acting without thinking and sexual promiscuity Lack of awareness of one's own behaviors and abilities Slowness in processing thoughts or ''finding'' words Difficulty in learning new information Psychiatric disorders The most common psychiatric disorder associated with Huntington's disease is depression. This isn't simply a reaction to receiving a diagnosis of Huntington's disease. Instead, depression appears to occur because of injury to the brain and subsequent changes in brain function. Signs and symptoms may include: Feelings of irritability, sadness or apathy Social withdrawal Insomnia Fatigue and loss of energy Frequent thoughts of death, dying or suicide Other common psychiatric disorders include: Obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition marked by recurrent, intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors Mania, which can cause elevated mood, overactivity, impulsive behavior and inflated self-esteem Bipolar disorder, a condition with alternating episodes of depression and mania In addition to the above disorders, weight loss is common in people with Huntington's disease, especially as the disease progresses. Symptoms of juvenile Huntington's disease The start and progression of Huntington's disease in younger people may be slightly different from that in adults. Problems that often present early in the course of the disease include: Behavioral changes Difficulty paying attention Rapid, significant drop in overall school performance Behavioral problems Physical changes Contracted and rigid muscles that affect gait (especially in young children) Tremors or slight involuntary movements Frequent falls or clumsiness Seizures When to see a doctor See your doctor if you notice changes in your movements, emotional state or mental ability.

However, contact your doctor if a new pelvic pain becomes severe, if it's accompanied by nausea or fever, or if it persists — any of which could indicate you have a condition more serious than mittelschmerz, such as appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease or even an ectopic pregnancy.

Because this disease causes your body to generate new bone faster than normal, the rapid remodeling produces bone that's less organized and weaker than normal bone, which can lead to bone pain, deformities and fractures. The disease might affect only one or two areas of your body or might be widespread. Your signs and symptoms, if any, will depend on the affected part of your body. Pelvis. Paget's disease of bone in the pelvis can cause hip pain. Skull. An overgrowth of bone in the skull can cause hearing loss or headaches. Spine. If your spine is affected, nerve roots can become compressed. This can cause pain, tingling and numbness in an arm or leg. Leg. As the bones weaken, they may bend — causing you to become bowlegged.

These may include: Congested or runny nose Dry cough Low-grade fever Sore throat Sneezing Headache In severe cases RSV infection can spread to the lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia or bronchiolitis — inflammation of the small airway passages entering the lungs. Signs and symptoms may include: Fever Severe cough Wheezing — a high-pitched noise that's usually heard on breathing out (exhaling) Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing — the person may prefer to sit up rather than lie down Bluish color of the skin due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis) Infants are most severely affected by RSV. Signs and symptoms of severe RSV infection in infants include: Short, shallow and rapid breathing Struggling to breathe — chest muscles and skin pull inward with each breath Cough Poor feeding Unusual tiredness (lethargy) Irritability Most children and adults recover in one to two weeks, although some might have repeated wheezing. Severe or life-threatening infection requiring a hospital stay may occur in premature infants or in anyone who has chronic heart or lung problems. RSV and COVID-19 Because RSV and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are both types of respiratory viruses, some symptoms of RSV and COVID-19 can be similar. In children, COVID-19 often results in mild symptoms such as fever, runny nose and cough. For adults with COVID-19, symptoms may be more severe and may include trouble breathing.

If you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, your doctor may recommend testing for COVID-19.

Gas is likely the result of swallowed air during prolonged crying.

When to see a doctor You'll likely have your blood pressure taken as part of a routine doctor's appointment. Ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18. If you're age 40 or older, or you're 18 to 39 with a high risk of high blood pressure, ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading every year. Blood pressure generally should be checked in both arms to determine if there's a difference. It's important to use an appropriate-sized arm cuff. Your doctor will likely recommend more-frequent readings if you've already been diagnosed with high blood pressure or have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Children age 3 and older will usually have blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups. If you don't regularly see your doctor, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community. You can also find machines in some stores that will measure your blood pressure for free. Public blood pressure machines, such as those found in pharmacies, may provide helpful information about your blood pressure, but they may have some limitations.

       "  'symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome can vary among individuals. Symptoms may slowly change over time from childhood to adulthood. Infants Signs and symptoms that may be present from birth include: Poor muscle tone. A primary sign during infancy is poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed, and they may feel floppy or like rag dolls when they're held. Distinct facial features. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip. Poor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone. Poor sucking makes feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive. Generally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem unusually tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry. Underdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicles may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In females, the clitoris and labia may be small. Early childhood to adulthood Other features of Prader-Willi syndrome appear during early childhood and remain throughout life, requiring careful management. These features may include: Food craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food, resulting in rapid weight gain, starting around age 2 years. Constant hunger leads to eating often and consuming large portions. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food, or eating frozen food or even garbage, may develop. Underdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organs (testes in men and ovaries in women) produce little or no sex hormones. This results in underdeveloped sex organs, incomplete or delayed puberty, and in nearly all cases, infertility. Without treatment, women may not start menstruating until their 30s or may never menstruate, and men may not have much facial hair and their voices may never fully deepen. Poor growth and physical development. Underproduction of growth hormone can result in short adult height, low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problems may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency, which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections. Cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate intellectual disability, such as issues with thinking, reasoning and problem-solving, is a common feature of the disorder. Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities. Delayed motor development. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestones in physical movement — for example, sitting up or walking — later than other children do. Speech problems. Speech is often delayed. Poor articulation of words may be an ongoing problem into adulthood. Behavioral problems. Children and adults may at times be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food, and may not tolerate changes in routine. They may also develop obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and skin picking, may develop. Sleep disorders. Children and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome may have sleep disorders, including disruptions of the normal sleep cycle and a condition in which breathing pauses during sleep (sleep apnea). These disorders can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and worsen behavior problems. Other signs and symptoms. These may include small hands and feet, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), hip problems, reduced saliva flow, nearsightedness and other vision problems, problems regulating body temperature, a high pain tolerance, or a lack of pigment (hypopigmentation) causing hair, eyes and skin to be pale. When to see a doctor Regularly scheduled well-baby visits can help identify early signs of poor growth and development, which can be signs of Prader-Willi syndrome or other disorders. If you have concerns about your baby's health between well-baby visits, schedule an appointment with your child's doctor. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

Symptoms can develop with moderate or heavy infestation, sometimes progressing as the parasite travels through your body. Initial signs and symptoms You swallow trichinella larvae encased in a cyst. Your digestive juices dissolve the cyst, releasing the parasite into your body. The larvae then penetrate the wall of the small intestine, where they mature into adult worms and mate. At this stage, you may experience: Diarrhea Abdominal pain Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Later signs and symptoms About a week after infection, the adult female worms produce larvae that go through the intestinal wall, enter your bloodstream, and eventually burrow into muscle or other tissue.

Call a suicide hotline number — in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). Use that same number and press \"1\" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line. Reach out to a close friend or loved one. Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.

You may think you can deal with earwax on your own, but there's no way to know if you have excessive earwax without having someone, usually your doctor, look in your ears. Having signs and symptoms, such as earache or decreased hearing, doesn't necessarily mean you have wax buildup. It's possible you have another medical condition involving your ears that may need attention. Wax removal is most safely done by a doctor. Your ear canal and eardrum are delicate and can be damaged easily by excess earwax. Don't try to remove earwax yourself with any device placed into your ear canal, especially if you have had ear surgery, have a hole (perforation) in your eardrum, or are having ear pain or drainage. Children usually have their ears checked as part of any medical examination. If necessary, a doctor can remove excess earwax from your child's ear during an office visit. \"},\n",

Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes? It could be eye floaters. \"In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called \\'the vitreous.\\' When we\\'re young, it\\'s a firm clump of jelly. As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces. Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floaters,\" says Dr. Khan. Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you\\'re nearsighted. The biggest concern – they can cause retinal tears. \"If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall,\" says Dr. Khan. \"And that\\'s a retinal detachment.\" And that can cause blindness, which is why it\\'s especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision.

If your symptoms respond to antibiotics, additional testing isn't necessary. But if the redness does not improve, your doctor may consider more serious causes of your symptoms, such as inflammatory breast cancer. If you've been treated for a breast infection but your signs and symptoms persist, contact your doctor. Your doctor may recommend a mammogram or other test to evaluate your signs and symptoms.

Seek immediate medical help if you have shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or near fainting, and chest pain or discomfort. A type of arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure. Collapse can occur within seconds and soon the person's breathing and pulse will stop. If this occurs, follow these steps: Call 911 or the emergency number in your area. If there's no one nearby trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), provide hands-only CPR. Push hard and fast on the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute until paramedics arrive. You don't need to do rescue breathing. If you or someone nearby knows CPR, start CPR. CPR can help maintain blood flow to the organs until an electrical shock (defibrillation) can be given. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available nearby, have someone get the device and follow the instructions.

Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events — even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive.

The rash can also appear on the arms, face and trunk and may be worse in areas of pressure, such as the sock line and waistline. Swollen, sore joints (arthritis). People with Henoch-Schonlein purpura often have pain and swelling around the joints — mainly in the knees and ankles. Joint pain sometimes precedes the classical rash by one or two weeks. These symptoms subside when the disease clears and leave no lasting damage. Digestive tract symptoms. Many children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura develop belly pain, nausea, vomiting and bloody stools. These symptoms sometimes occur before the rash appears. Kidney involvement. Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also affect the kidneys. In most cases, this shows up as protein or blood in the urine, which you may not even know is there unless you have a urine test done. Usually this goes away once the illness passes, but some people develop persistent kidney disease. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have Henoch-Schonlein purpura and it's causing serious problems with your digestive tract. If your child develops the rash associated with this condition, see your doctor as soon as possible. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes? It could be eye floaters. \"In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called \\'the vitreous.\\' When we\\'re young, it\\'s a firm clump of jelly. As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces. Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floaters,\" says Dr. Khan. Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you\\'re nearsighted. The biggest concern – they can cause retinal tears. \"If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall,\" says Dr. Khan. \"And that\\'s a retinal detachment.\" And that can cause blindness, which is why it\\'s especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision. Most eye floaters don\\'t require treatment, but your eye doctor likely will recommend regular eye exams to ensure the condition doesn\\'t worsen. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

       " {'illness': 'Childhood schizophrenia',\n",
       "  'symptoms': 'Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases. Early signs and symptoms Schizophrenia signs and symptoms in children and teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group. Early signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions. Thinking: Problems with thinking and reasoning Bizarre ideas or speech Confusing dreams or television for reality Behavior: Withdrawal from friends and family Trouble sleeping Lack of motivation — for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing Bizarre behavior Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation Recreational drug or nicotine use Emotions: Irritability or depressed mood Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation Strange anxieties and fears Excessive suspicion of others Later signs and symptoms As children with schizophrenia age, more typical signs and symptoms of the disorder begin to appear. Signs and symptoms may include: Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you\\'re being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don\\'t exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking. Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can\\'t be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion — doesn\\'t make eye contact, doesn\\'t change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn\\'t add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure. Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be: Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations Symptoms may be difficult to interpret When childhood schizophrenia begins early in life, symptoms may build up gradually. Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can\\'t recognize what\\'s wrong. Some early signs can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptoms of other mental or physical conditions. As time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable. Eventually, your child may develop the symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions and difficulty organizing thoughts. As thoughts become more disorganized, there\\'s often a \"break from reality\" (psychosis) frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment with medication. When to see a doctor It can be difficult to know how to handle vague behavioral changes in your child. You may be afraid of rushing to conclusions that label your child with a mental illness. Your child\\'s teacher or other school staff may alert you to changes in your child\\'s behavior. Seek medical care as soon as possible if you have concerns about your child\\'s behavior or development. Suicidal thoughts and behavior Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with schizophrenia. If you have a child or teen who is in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with him or her. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or if you think you can do so safely, take your child to the nearest hospital emergency room. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

       " {'illness': 'Rett syndrome',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Babies with Rett syndrome typically are born after a normal pregnancy and delivery. Most infants with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave normally for the first six months. After that, signs and symptoms start to appear. The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity can vary greatly from child to child. Rett syndrome signs and symptoms include: Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than normal head size (microcephaly) is usually the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, delayed growth in other parts of the body becomes evident. Loss of normal movement and coordination. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk normally. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or may become rigid or spastic with abnormal movement and positioning. Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of speech. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Abnormal hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome typically develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements that may differ for each person. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing. Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time. Breathing problems. These include breath-holding, abnormally rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forceful exhalation of air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours, but breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or periodic breathing can occur during sleep. Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety. Other abnormal behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing. Cognitive disabilities. Loss of skills can be accompanied by a loss of intellectual functioning. Seizures. Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives. Multiple seizure types may occur and are accompanied by an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). Abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and increases with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe. Irregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death. Sleep disturbances. Abnormal sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming. Other symptoms. A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as thin, fragile bones prone to factures; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding. Stages of Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages: Stage I: early onset. Signs and symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which starts between 6 and 18 months of age and can last for a few months or a year. Babies in this stage may show less eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delays in sitting or crawling. Stage II: rapid deterioration. Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such as slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or crying for no apparent reason, problems with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication. Stage III: plateau. The third stage usually begins between the ages of 2 and 10 years and can last for many years. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may have limited improvement, with less crying and irritability, and some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2. Stage IV: late motor deterioration. This stage usually begins after the age of 10 and can last for years or decades. It's marked by reduced mobility, muscle weakness, joint contractures and scoliosis. Understanding, communication and hand skills generally remain stable or improve slightly, and seizures may occur less often. When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of Rett syndrome can be subtle in the early stages. See your child's doctor right away if you begin to notice physical problems or changes in behavior after apparently normal development, such as: Slowed growth of your child's head or other parts of the body Decreased coordination or mobility Repetitive hand movements Decreasing eye contact or loss of interest in normal play Delayed speech development or loss of previously acquired speech abilities Problem behavior or marked mood swings Any clear loss of previously gained milestones in gross motor or fine motor skills Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

You might notice that your child appears clumsier than usual, particularly in the morning or after naps. Fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash. In some cases, high fever, swollen lymph nodes or a rash on the trunk may occur — which is usually worse in the evenings. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can affect one joint or many. There are several different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but the main ones are systemic, oligoarticular and polyarticular. Which type your child has depends on symptoms, the number of joints affected, and if a fever and rashes are prominent features.

Although girls can be carriers and mildly affected, it's much more common in boys. Signs and symptoms, which typically appear in early childhood, might include: Frequent falls Difficulty rising from a lying or sitting position Trouble running and jumping Waddling gait Walking on the toes Large calf muscles Muscle pain and stiffness Learning disabilities Delayed growth Becker muscular dystrophy Signs and symptoms are similar to those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but tend to be milder and progress more slowly. Symptoms generally begin in the teens but might not occur until the mid-20s or later. Other types of muscular dystrophy Some types of muscular dystrophy are defined by a specific feature or by where in the body symptoms begin. Examples include: Myotonic. This is characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions. Facial and neck muscles are usually the first to be affected. People with this form typically have long, thin faces; drooping eyelids; and swanlike necks. Facioscapulohumeral (FSHD). Muscle weakness typically begins in the face, hip and shoulders. The shoulder blades might stick out like wings when arms are raised. Onset usually occurs in the teenage years but can begin in childhood or as late as age 50. Congenital. This type affects boys and girls and is apparent at birth or before age 2. Some forms progress slowly and cause only mild disability, while others progress rapidly and cause severe impairment. Limb-girdle. Hip and shoulder muscles are usually affected first. People with this type of muscular dystrophy might have difficulty lifting the front part of the foot and so might trip frequently.

The amount of vaginal bleeding can vary greatly, and doesn't necessarily indicate how much of the placenta has separated from the uterus. It's possible for the blood to become trapped inside the uterus, so even with a severe placental abruption, there might be no visible bleeding. In some cases, placental abruption develops slowly (chronic abruption), which can cause light, intermittent vaginal bleeding.

Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more impaired you become. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, impaired judgment, slurred speech, impaired attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called \"blackouts,\" where you don\\'t remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma or even death. Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to four or five days later.

Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations. What is considered 1 drink? The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these: 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5 percent alcohol) 8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7 percent alcohol) 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of unfortified wine (about 12 percent alcohol) 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of 80-proof hard liquor (about 40 percent alcohol) When to see a doctor If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or your drinking is causing problems, or your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your doctor. Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health professional or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group. Because denial is common, you may not feel like you have a problem with drinking. You might not recognize how much you drink or how many problems in your life are related to alcohol use. Listen to relatives, friends or co-workers when they ask you to examine your drinking habits or to seek help. Consider talking with someone who has had a problem drinking, but has stopped. If your loved one needs help Many people with alcohol use disorder hesitate to get treatment because they don\\'t recognize they have a problem. An intervention from loved ones can help some people recognize and accept that they need professional help. If you\\'re concerned about someone who drinks too much, ask a professional experienced in alcohol treatment for advice on how to approach that person. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

Periodic or long-lasting wheezing and other asthma-like symptoms can be caused by infectious bronchitis or another respiratory problem. When to see a doctor Take your child to see the doctor if you suspect he or she has asthma. Early treatment will help control symptoms and possibly prevent asthma attacks. Make an appointment with your child\\'s doctor if you notice: Coughing that is constant, is intermittent or seems linked to physical activity Wheezing or whistling sounds when your child breathes out Shortness of breath or rapid breathing Complaints of chest tightness Repeated episodes of suspected bronchitis or pneumonia If your child has asthma, he or she may say things such as, \"My chest feels funny\" or \"I\\'m always coughing.\" Listen for coughing, which might not wake your child, when he or she is asleep. Crying, laughing, yelling, or strong emotional reactions and stress also might trigger coughing or wheezing. If your child is diagnosed with asthma, creating an asthma plan can help you and other caregivers monitor symptoms and know what to do if an asthma attack occurs. When to seek emergency treatment In severe cases, you might see your child\\'s chest and sides pulling inward as he or she struggles to breathe. Your child might have an increased heartbeat, sweating and chest pain.

They generally occur on the face or legs and are more common in children and teens than in adults. Female genital warts Female genital warts Female genital warts Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection. They can appear on the genitals, in the pubic area or in the anal canal. In women, genital warts can also grow inside the vagina. Male genital warts Male genital warts Male genital warts Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection. They can appear on the genitals, in the pubic area or in the anal canal. In most cases, your body's immune system defeats an HPV infection before it creates warts. When warts do appear, they vary in appearance depending on which kind of HPV is involved: Genital warts. These appear as flat lesions, small cauliflower-like bumps or tiny stemlike protrusions. In women, genital warts appear mostly on the vulva but can also occur near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina. In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch or feel tender. Common warts. Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps and usually occur on the hands and fingers. In most cases, common warts are simply unsightly, but they can also be painful or susceptible to injury or bleeding. Plantar warts. Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of your feet. These warts might cause discomfort. Flat warts. Flat warts are flat-topped, slightly raised lesions. They can appear anywhere, but children usually get them on the face and men tend to get them in the beard area. Women tend to get them on the legs. Cervical cancer Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections, but cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an HPV infection. The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don't cause noticeable symptoms. Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is your best protection from cervical cancer. Because early cervical cancer doesn't cause symptoms, it's vital that women have regular screening tests to detect any precancerous changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. Current guidelines recommend that women ages 21 to 29 have a Pap test every three years. Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to continue having a Pap test every three years, or every five years if they also get the HPV DNA test at the same time. Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three normal Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no abnormal results.

Talk to your doctor about any change in the color or size of a mole or if itching, pain, bleeding or inflammation develops. Melanoma Melanoma Melanoma The first sign of melanoma is often a mole that changes size, shape or color. This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera). An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any skin changes that seem unusual.

Laryngitis signs and symptoms can include: Hoarseness Weak voice or voice loss Tickling sensation and rawness in your throat Sore throat Dry throat Dry cough When to see a doctor You can manage most acute cases of laryngitis with self-care steps, such as resting your voice and drinking plenty of fluids. Strenuous use of your voice during an episode of acute laryngitis can damage your vocal cords. Make an appointment with a doctor if your laryngitis symptoms last more than two weeks. Seek immediate medical attention if you: Have trouble breathing Cough up blood Have a fever that won't go away Have increasing pain over weeks Seek immediate medical attention if your child: Makes noisy, high-pitched breathing sounds when inhaling (stridor) Drools more than usual Has trouble swallowing Has difficulty breathing Has a fever These signs and symptoms may indicate croup — inflammation of the larynx and the airway just beneath it. Although croup can usually be treated at home, severe symptoms require medical attention. These symptoms can also indicate epiglottitis, an inflammation of the tissue that acts as a lid (epiglottis) to cover the windpipe (trachea), which can be life-threatening for children and adults.

They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them. Shape. Most moles are oval or round. Size. Moles are usually less than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth (congenital nevi) can be bigger than usual, covering part of the face, torso or a limb. Moles can develop anywhere on your body, including your scalp, armpits, under your nails, and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 40 moles. Many of these develop by age 50. Moles may change or fade away over time. With hormonal changes in adolescence and pregnancy, they may become darker and larger. Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are sometimes called flesh moles, but they are actually dermatoses papulosa nigra — a type of seborrheic keratosis, not clusters of pigment-forming cells (nevi). Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. Flesh moles don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated if you consider them a cosmetic concern. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma A mole may be a sign of skin cancer if it has irregular borders or an asymmetrical shape or if it changes in color, shape, size or height. This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for: A is for asymmetrical shape. One half is unlike the other half. B is for border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders. C is for color. Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above. Others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.

Anorexia also includes emotional and behavioral issues involving an unrealistic perception of body weight and an extremely strong fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. It may be difficult to notice signs and symptoms because what is considered a low body weight is different for each person, and some individuals may not appear extremely thin. Also, people with anorexia often disguise their thinness, eating habits or physical problems. Physical symptoms Physical signs and symptoms of anorexia may include: Extreme weight loss or not making expected developmental weight gains Thin appearance Abnormal blood counts Fatigue Insomnia Dizziness or fainting Bluish discoloration of the fingers Hair that thins, breaks or falls out Soft, downy hair covering the body Absence of menstruation Constipation and abdominal pain Dry or yellowish skin Intolerance of cold Irregular heart rhythms Low blood pressure Dehydration Swelling of arms or legs Eroded teeth and calluses on the knuckles from induced vomiting Some people who have anorexia binge and purge, similar to individuals who have bulimia. But people with anorexia generally struggle with an abnormally low body weight, while individuals with bulimia typically are normal to above normal weight. Emotional and behavioral symptoms Behavioral symptoms of anorexia may include attempts to lose weight by: Severely restricting food intake through dieting or fasting Exercising excessively Bingeing and self-induced vomiting to get rid of food, which may include the use of laxatives, enemas, diet aids or herbal products Emotional and behavioral signs and symptoms may include: Preoccupation with food, which sometimes includes cooking elaborate meals for others but not eating them Frequently skipping meals or refusing to eat Denial of hunger or making excuses for not eating Eating only a few certain \"safe\" foods, usually those low in fat and calories Adopting rigid meal or eating rituals, such as spitting food out after chewing Not wanting to eat in public Lying about how much food has been eaten Fear of gaining weight that may include repeated weighing or measuring the body Frequent checking in the mirror for perceived flaws Complaining about being fat or having parts of the body that are fat Covering up in layers of clothing Flat mood (lack of emotion) Social withdrawal Irritability Insomnia Reduced interest in sex When to see a doctor Unfortunately, many people with anorexia don\\'t want treatment, at least initially. Their desire to remain thin overrides concerns about their health. If you have a loved one you\\'re worried about, urge her or him to talk to a doctor. If you\\'re experiencing any of the problems listed above, or if you think you may have an eating disorder, get help.

Most types of psoriasis go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a time or even going into remission. There are several types of psoriasis, including: Plaque psoriasis. The most common form, plaque psoriasis causes dry, raised, red skin patches (lesions) covered with silvery scales. The plaques might be itchy or tender, and there may be few or many. They usually appear on elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. Nail psoriasis.

Severe cases may cause the nail to crumble. Guttate psoriasis. This type primarily affects young adults and children. It\\'s usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It\\'s marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling lesions on the trunk, arms or legs. Inverse psoriasis. This mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis.

       "  'symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system can develop relatively quickly, often over days to weeks. Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include: Difficulty walking Difficulty maintaining balance Loss of muscle coordination Loss of muscle tone or weakness Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects Difficulty swallowing Slurred speech or stuttering Memory loss and other thinking (cognitive) impairment Vision problems Sleep disturbances Seizures Hallucinations Unusual involuntary movements Types of paraneoplastic syndromes Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include: Cerebellar degeneration. This is the loss of nerve cells in the area of the brain that controls muscle functions and balance (cerebellum). Signs and symptoms may include unsteady or impaired walking, lack of muscle coordination in your limbs, inability to maintain your trunk posture, dizziness, nausea, involuntary eye movement, double vision, difficulty speaking, or difficulty swallowing. Limbic encephalitis. This is inflammation affecting a region of the brain known as the limbic system, which controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions. People with this disorder may experience personality changes or mood disturbances, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness. Encephalomyelitis. This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There may be a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the area affected. Opsoclonus-myoclonus. This syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections. It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements (opsoclonus) and involuntary, chaotic muscle jerks (myoclonus) in your limbs and trunk. Stiff person syndrome. Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome is characterized by progressive, severe muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly affecting your spine and legs. It may also cause painful muscle spasms. Myelopathy. This term refers to a syndrome of injury limited to the spinal cord. Depending on the level of spinal cord injury, you may have changes in bowel and bladder function, and severe weakness and numbness up to a certain level in your body. If the level of injury includes your neck, you can have severe disability affecting all four limbs. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. This is a syndrome caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. Signs and symptoms include pelvic and lower extremity muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. Autonomic nervous system problems can include dry mouth and impotence. When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer. Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is also related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles and also characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control, including muscles in your face, eyes, arms and legs. The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well. When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland (thymoma). Neuromyotonia. Neuromyotonia — also known as Isaacs\\' syndrome — is characterized by abnormal impulses in nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerve hyperexcitability) that control muscle movement. These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a \"bag of worms,\" progressive stiffness, muscle cramps, slowed movement and other muscle impairments. Peripheral neuropathy. This condition refers to patterns of damage to nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of your body. When damage involves only the sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system, you can have pain and disturbances in sensation anywhere in your body. Dysautonomia. Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of signs and symptoms resulting from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions (autonomic nervous system), such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. When this part of the nervous system is affected, common symptoms are low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing. When to see a doctor The signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are similar to those of many conditions, including cancer, cancer complications and even some cancer treatments. But if you have any signs or symptoms suggesting a paraneoplastic syndrome, see your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and appropriate care can be extremely important.

       " {'illness': 'Grand mal seizure',\n",
       "  'symptoms': 'Grand mal seizures have two stages: Tonic phase. Loss of consciousness occurs, and the muscles suddenly contract and cause the person to fall down. This phase tends to last about 10 to 20 seconds. Clonic phase. The muscles go into rhythmic contractions, alternately flexing and relaxing. Convulsions usually last one to two minutes or less. The following signs and symptoms occur in some but not all people with grand mal seizures: A scream. Some people may cry out at the beginning of a seizure. Loss of bowel and bladder control. This may happen during or following a seizure. Unresponsiveness after convulsions. Unconsciousness may persist for several minutes after the convulsion has ended. Confusion. A period of disorientation often follows a grand mal seizure. This is referred to as postictal confusion. Fatigue. Sleepiness is common after a grand mal seizure. Severe headache. Headaches may occur after a grand mal seizure. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes Breathing or consciousness doesn\\'t return after the seizure stops A second seizure follows immediately You have a high fever You\\'re experiencing heat exhaustion. You\\'re pregnant. You have diabetes. You\\'ve injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. Additionally, seek medical advice for yourself or your child: If the number of seizures experienced increases significantly without explanation If new seizure signs or symptoms appear @font-face

Other times, symptoms appear suddenly and then disappear just as quickly. Many people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms, so the disease may be discovered only when a chest X-ray is done for another reason. General symptoms Sarcoidosis can begin with these signs and symptoms: Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes Weight loss Pain and swelling in joints, such as the ankles Lung symptoms Sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs and may cause lung problems, such as: Persistent dry cough Shortness of breath Wheezing Chest pain Skin symptoms Sarcoidosis may cause skin problems, which may include: A rash of red or reddish-purple bumps, usually located on the shins or ankles, which may be warm and tender to the touch Disfiguring sores (lesions) on the nose, cheeks and ears Areas of skin that are darker or lighter in color Growths under the skin (nodules), particularly around scars or tattoos Eye symptoms Sarcoidosis can affect the eyes without causing any symptoms, so it\\'s important to have your eyes checked regularly. When eye signs and symptoms do occur, they may include: Blurred vision Eye pain Burning, itching or dry eyes Severe redness Sensitivity to light Heart symptoms Cardiac sarcoidosis: A heart under attack Click here for an infographic to learn more Signs and symptoms related to cardiac sarcoidosis may include: Chest pain Shortness of breath (dyspnea) Fainting (syncope) Fatigue Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) Rapid or fluttering heart beat (palpitations) Swelling caused by excess fluid (edema) Sarcoidosis can also affect calcium metabolism, the nervous system, the liver and spleen, muscles, bones and joints, the kidneys, lymph nodes, or any other organ.

They are two special little girls and that really makes life nice. I never had a symptom until that first day of the actual heart attack. I was 100 percent blocked. Diana, spouse: They put 2 or 3 stents in — the doctors would — and then within months, Jim would have the same kind of symptoms again. Jim: I was in the hospital again and this time, it was open-heart surgery. Diana: Oh, my gosh, when he opened Jim up, he said I\\'ve seen something today that I\\'ve never seen on anybody. Jim: It was discovered at that time that I had sarcoidosis. Diana: You\\'re going to have to go to the Mayo Clinic. Leslie Cooper, M.D., Mayo Clinic Cardiology: He had rapid re-narrowing to the arteries to his heart after they had placed stents. In his case, they were related to an autoimmune disease, sarcoidosis. Diana: The treatment, the doctors, the teamwork was unbelievable. Leslie Cooper, M.D.: We took an established drug in another area and applied it for the first time in cardiac sarcoidosis. Diana: It was experimental, but it put that sarcoid into remission and that gave Jim his life back. It turned out to be a really good risk. Jim: I didn\\'t realize that the Mayo Clinic was so accessible. When I go there I have no doubt that I\\'m going to meet competent people in their work and their field. That, I think, gives you the confidence to trust that you are going to be okay. My experience at Mayo I think has helped me be here for my grandkids. I\\'m just so thankful to be here.

If your clotting-factor level is mildly reduced, you might bleed only after surgery or trauma. If your deficiency is severe, you can bleed easily for seemingly no reason. Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bleeding include: Unexplained and excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, or after surgery or dental work Many large or deep bruises Unusual bleeding after vaccinations Pain, swelling or tightness in your joints Blood in your urine or stool Nosebleeds without a known cause In infants, unexplained irritability Bleeding into the brain A simple bump on the head can cause bleeding into the brain for some people who have severe hemophilia. This rarely happens, but it's one of the most serious complications that can occur. Signs and symptoms include: Painful, prolonged headache Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or lethargy Double vision Sudden weakness or clumsiness Convulsions or seizures When to see a doctor Seek emergency care if you or your child has: Signs or symptoms of bleeding into the brain An injury in which the bleeding won't stop Swollen joints that are hot to the touch and painful to bend Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

A core body temperature of 104 F (40 C) or higher, obtained with a rectal thermometer, is the main sign of heatstroke. Altered mental state or behavior. Confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and coma can all result from heatstroke. Alteration in sweating. In heatstroke brought on by hot weather, your skin will feel hot and dry to the touch. However, in heatstroke brought on by strenuous exercise, your skin may feel dry or slightly moist. Nausea and vomiting. You may feel sick to your stomach or vomit. Flushed skin. Your skin may turn red as your body temperature increases. Rapid breathing. Your breathing may become rapid and shallow. Racing heart rate. Your pulse may significantly increase because heat stress places a tremendous burden on your heart to help cool your body. Headache. Your head may throb. When to see a doctor If you think a person may be experiencing heatstroke, seek immediate medical help. Call 911 or your local emergency services number. Take immediate action to cool the overheated person while waiting for emergency treatment. Get the person into shade or indoors. Remove excess clothing. Cool the person with whatever means available — put in a cool tub of water or a cool shower, spray with a garden hose, sponge with cool water, fan while misting with cool water, or place ice packs or cold, wet towels on the person's head, neck, armpits and groin.

If breast stimulation — such as excessive nipple manipulation during sexual activity — triggers nipple discharge from multiple ducts, you have little cause for worry. The discharge probably doesn't signal anything abnormal, and this discharge often resolves on its own. If you have persistent discharge that doesn't go away, make an appointment with your doctor to get it checked out. Nonmilky nipple discharge — particularly bloody, yellow or clear spontaneous discharge that comes from one duct or is associated with a lump you can feel — requires prompt medical attention, as it may be a sign of an underlying breast cancer.

In general, tachycardia may lead to the following signs and symptoms: Sensation of a racing, pounding heartbeat or flopping in the chest (palpitations) Chest pain Fainting (syncope) Lightheadedness Rapid pulse rate Shortness of breath Some people with tachycardia have no symptoms. The condition may be discovered when a physical exam or heart tests are done for another reason. When to see a doctor A number of things can cause a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). If you feel like your heart is beating too fast, make an appointment to see a health care provider. Seek immediate medical help if you have shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or near fainting, and chest pain or discomfort. A type of tachycardia called ventricular fibrillation can cause blood pressure to drop dramatically. Collapse can occur within seconds. Soon the affected person's breathing and pulse will stop. If this occurs, do the following: Call 911 or the emergency number in your area. If you or someone nearby is well trained in CPR, start CPR. CPR can help maintain blood flow to the organs until an electrical shock (defibrillation) can be given. If you're not trained in CPR or worried about giving rescue breaths, then provide hands-only CPR. Push hard and fast on the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute until paramedics arrive. You don't need to do rescue breathing. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available nearby, have someone get the device for you, and then follow the instructions. An AED is a portable defibrillation device that can deliver a shock to reset the heart rhythm. No training is required to use the device. The AED will tell you what to do.

       " {'illness': 'Craniosynostosis',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they'll become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. These can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected An abnormal feeling or disappearing fontanel on your baby's skull Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures Slow or no growth of the head as your baby grows Types of craniosynostosis There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Most cases of multiple suture craniosynostosis are linked to genetic syndromes and are called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. Sagittal craniosynostosis results in a head shape called scaphocephaly and is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of your baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side. Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time on one side of his or her head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more normal appearance. When to see a doctor Your doctor will routinely monitor your child's head growth at well-child visits. Talk to your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby's head growth or shape.

Episodic tension-type headaches Episodic tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to a week. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches occur less than 15 days a month for at least three months. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches may become chronic. Chronic tension-type headaches This type of tension-type headache lasts hours and may be continuous. If your headaches occur 15 or more days a month for at least three months, they're considered chronic. Tension-type headaches versus migraines Tension-type headaches can be difficult to distinguish from migraines. Plus, if you have frequent episodic tension-type headaches, you can also have migraines. Unlike some forms of migraine, tension-type headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances, nausea or vomiting. Although physical activity typically aggravates migraine pain, it doesn't make tension-type headache pain worse. An increased sensitivity to either light or sound can occur with a tension-type headache, but this symptom isn't common. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor If tension-type headaches disrupt your life or you need to take medication for your headaches more than twice a week, see your doctor.

Signs and symptoms can begin within a few hours after infection, and may include: Cough, with bloody mucus (sputum) Difficulty breathing Nausea and vomiting High fever Headache Weakness Chest pain Pneumonic plague progresses rapidly and may cause respiratory failure and shock within two days of infection. Pneumonic plague needs to be treated with antibiotics within a day after signs and symptoms first appear, or the infection is likely to be fatal. When to see a doctor If you begin to feel ill and have been in an area where plague has been known to occur, seek immediate medical attention. You'll need treatment with medication to prevent serious complications or death. In the United States, plague has been transmitted to humans in several western and southwestern states — primarily New Mexico, Arizona, California and Colorado.

Signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include: Prickling, pins and needles sensations in your fingers, toes, ankles or wrists Weakness in your legs that spreads to your upper body Unsteady walking or inability to walk or climb stairs Difficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing Double vision or inability to move eyes Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night Difficulty with bladder control or bowel function Rapid heart rate Low or high blood pressure Difficulty breathing People with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin. Types Once thought to be a single disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome is now known to occur in several forms. The main types are: Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), the most common form in North America and Europe. The most common sign of AIDP is muscle weakness that starts in the lower part of your body and spreads upward. Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), in which paralysis starts in the eyes. MFS is also associated with unsteady gait. MFS is less common in the U.S. but more common in Asia.

       "  'symptoms': \"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include: Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45. Symptoms in teenagers Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen years, such as: Withdrawal from friends and family A drop in performance at school Trouble sleeping Irritability or depressed mood Lack of motivation Also, recreational substance use, such as marijuana, methamphetamines or LSD, can sometimes cause similar signs and symptoms. Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, teens may be: Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations When to see a doctor People with schizophrenia often lack awareness that their difficulties stem from a mental disorder that requires medical attention. So it often falls to family or friends to get them help. Helping someone who may have schizophrenia If you think someone you know may have symptoms of schizophrenia, talk to him or her about your concerns. Although you can't force someone to seek professional help, you can offer encouragement and support and help your loved one find a qualified doctor or mental health professional. If your loved one poses a danger to self or others or can't provide his or her own food, clothing, or shelter, you may need to call 911 or other emergency responders for help so that your loved one can be evaluated by a mental health professional. In some cases, emergency hospitalization may be needed. Laws on involuntary commitment for mental health treatment vary by state. You can contact community mental health agencies or police departments in your area for details. Suicidal thoughts and behavior Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with schizophrenia. If you have a loved one who is in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

In the intestines The larvae mature into adult worms in the small intestine, and the adult worms typically live in the intestines until they die. In mild or moderate ascariasis, the intestinal infestation can cause: Vague abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea or bloody stools If you have a large number of worms in the intestine, you might have: Severe abdominal pain Fatigue Vomiting Weight loss or malnutrition A worm in your vomit or stool When to see a doctor Talk to your doctor if you have persistent abdominal pain, diarrhea or nausea.

Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocations are common. Stretchy skin. Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when you let go. Your skin might also feel exceptionally soft and velvety. Fragile skin. Damaged skin often doesn't heal well. For example, the stitches used to close a wound often will tear out and leave a gaping scar. These scars may look thin and crinkly. Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal.

Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Call your mental health professional. Call a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or use its webchat on suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat. Seek help from your primary care doctor or other health care provider. Reach out to a close friend or loved one. Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. If a loved one or friend is in danger of attempting suicide or has made an attempt: Make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. Never ignore comments or concerns about suicide. Always take action to get help.

       "  'symptoms': 'Primary syphilis Primary syphilis Primary syphilis Primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) on the genitals, rectum, tongue or lips. The disease can be present with the appearance of a single chancre (shown here on a penis) or many. Syphilis develops in stages, and symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap, and symptoms don\\'t always occur in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis without noticing any symptoms for years. Primary syphilis The first sign of syphilis is a small sore, called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. While most people infected with syphilis develop only one chancre, some people develop several of them. The chancre usually develops about three weeks after exposure. Many people who have syphilis don\\'t notice the chancre because it\\'s usually painless, and it may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre will heal on its own within three to six weeks. Secondary syphilis Within a few weeks of the original chancre healing, you may experience a rash that begins on your trunk but eventually covers your entire body — even the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. This rash is usually not itchy and may be accompanied by wartlike sores in your mouth or genital area. Some people also experience hair loss, muscle aches, a fever, a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms may disappear within a few weeks or repeatedly come and go for as long as a year. Latent syphilis If you aren\\'t treated for syphilis, the disease moves from the secondary stage to the hidden (latent) stage, when you have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years. Signs and symptoms may never return, or the disease may progress to the third (tertiary) stage. Tertiary syphilis About 15% to 30% of people infected with syphilis who don\\'t get treatment will develop complications known as tertiary syphilis. In the late stage, the disease may damage the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints. These problems may occur many years after the original, untreated infection. Neurosyphilis At any stage, syphilis can spread and, among other damage, cause damage to the brain and nervous system and the eye. Congenital syphilis Babies born to women who have syphilis can become infected through the placenta or during birth. Most newborns with congenital syphilis have no symptoms, although some experience a rash on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. Later signs and symptoms may include deafness, teeth deformities and saddle nose — where the bridge of the nose collapses. However, babies born with syphilis can also be born too early, may die in the womb before birth or can die after birth. When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you or your child experiences any unusual discharge, sore or rash — particularly if it occurs in the groin area.

Dr. Stacey Rizza, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic, says syphilis affects men and women and can present in various stages. Stacey Rizza, M.D.: Primary syphilis causes an ulcer, and this sometimes isn\\'t noticed because it\\'s painless and can be inside the vagina or on the cervix…after a few weeks, two months, they can get secondary syphilis, which is a rash. Vivien Williams: It may then progress to latent stage syphilis and, finally, the most serious stage: tertiary. Pregnant women are not immune to syphilis. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or infant deaths. That\\'s why all pregnant women should be screened. Syphilis is preventable and treatable. As for prevention, Dr. Rizza recommends barrier protection during sex. Dr. Rizza: And that\\'s during oral sex, anal sex, vaginal sex — using condoms, dental dams and any other barrier protection.

It's possible for inflammation to damage arteries for years before you realize something is wrong. Stage 2 During the second stage, inflammation causes arteries to narrow so less blood and oxygen and fewer nutrients reach your organs and tissues.

Signs and symptoms of transposition of the great arteries after birth include: Blue color of the skin (cyanosis) Shortness of breath Weak pulse Lack of appetite Poor weight gain A blue skin color may not be as noticeable in babies who are born with transposition of the great arteries and other congenital heart defects. This is because these other heart conditions — such as atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus — may allow some oxygen-rich blood to travel through the body. But as the baby becomes more active, the congenital heart defects won't allow enough blood through and eventually the blue skin color will become obvious.

Blackheads appear in small pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs. Painful pea-sized lumps. The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. Leaking bumps or sores. Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor. Tunnels. Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal very slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus. Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable.

Time is critical when you're helping an unconscious person who isn't breathing. If you see someone who's unconscious and not breathing normally, do the following: Call 911 or emergency medical help. If you have immediate access to a telephone, call before beginning CPR. Perform CPR. Quickly check the person's breathing. If the person isn't breathing normally, begin CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest — at the rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute. If you've been trained in CPR, check the person's airway and deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions. If you haven't been trained, just continue chest compressions. Allow the chest to rise completely between compressions. Keep doing this until a portable defibrillator is available or emergency workers arrive. Use a portable defibrillator, if one is available. It will give you step-by-step voice instructions. Continue chest compressions while the defibrillator is charging. When it's charged, the defibrillator will check the person's heart rhythm and recommend a shock if needed. Deliver one shock if advised by the device and then immediately resume CPR, starting with chest compressions, or give chest compressions only, for about two minutes. Using the defibrillator, check the person's heart rhythm. If necessary, the defibrillator will give another shock. Repeat this cycle until the person recovers consciousness or emergency workers take over. Portable automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are available in many places, including airports, casinos and shopping malls. You can also purchase one for your home.

Characteristics of variant angina (Prinzmetal's angina) Usually happens when you're resting Is often severe May be relieved by angina medication Angina in women Symptoms of angina in women can be different from angina symptoms that occur in men. These differences may lead to delays in seeking treatment. For example, chest pain is a common symptom in women with angina, but it may not be the only symptom or the most prevalent symptom for women. Women may also have symptoms such as: Nausea Shortness of breath Abdominal pain Discomfort in the neck, jaw or back Stabbing pain instead of chest pressure When to see a doctor If your chest pain lasts longer than a few minutes and doesn't go away when you rest or take your angina medications, it may be a sign you're having a heart attack.

The lowest part of your spinal cord that remains undamaged after an injury is referred to as the neurological level of your injury. The severity of the injury is often called \"the completeness\" and is classified as either of the following: Complete. If all feeling (sensory) and all ability to control movement (motor function) are lost below the spinal cord injury, your injury is called complete. Incomplete. If you have some motor or sensory function below the affected area, your injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury. Additionally, paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as: Tetraplegia. Also known as quadriplegia, this means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury. Paraplegia. This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs. Your health care team will perform a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury.

       "  'symptoms': \"Diphtheria signs and symptoms usually begin 2 to 5 days after a person becomes infected. Signs and symptoms may include: A thick, gray membrane covering the throat and tonsils A sore throat and hoarseness Swollen glands (enlarged lymph nodes) in the neck Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing Nasal discharge Fever and chills Tiredness In some people, infection with diphtheria-causing bacteria causes only a mild illness — or no obvious signs and symptoms at all. Infected people who stay unaware of their illness are known as carriers of diphtheria. They're called carriers because they can spread the infection without being sick themselves. Skin (cutaneous) diphtheria A second type of diphtheria can affect the skin, causing pain, redness and swelling similar to other bacterial skin infections. Ulcers covered by a gray membrane also may be a sign of skin diphtheria. Although it's more common in tropical climates, diphtheria on the skin also occurs in the United States. It may happen especially among people with poor hygiene who live in crowded conditions. When to see a doctor Call your family doctor immediately if you or your child has been exposed to someone with diphtheria. If you're not sure whether your child has been vaccinated against diphtheria, schedule an appointment. Make sure your own vaccinations are current. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",
       " {'illness': 'Bronchitis',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"For either acute bronchitis or chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include: Cough Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color — rarely, it may be streaked with blood Fatigue Shortness of breath Slight fever and chills Chest discomfort If you have acute bronchitis, you might have cold symptoms, such as a mild headache or body aches. While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with recurring bouts occurring for at least two consecutive years. If you have chronic bronchitis, you're likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. At those times, you may have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis. When to see a doctor See your doctor if your cough: Lasts more than three weeks Prevents you from sleeping Is accompanied by fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C) Produces discolored mucus Produces blood Is associated with wheezing or shortness of breath Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",
       " {'illness': 'Seizures',\n",
       "  'symptoms': 'With a seizure, signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary depending on the type of seizure. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion A staring spell Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs Loss of consciousness or awareness Cognitive or emotional symptoms, such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where abnormal brain activity begins. Seizures may also be classified as unknown onset, if how the seizure began isn\\'t known. Focal seizures Focal seizures result from abnormal electrical activity in one area of your brain. Focal seizures can occur with or without loss of consciousness: Focal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness that feels like being in a dream. You may seem awake, but you stare into space and do not respond normally to your environment or you perform repetitive movements. These may include hand rubbing, mouth movements, repeating certain words or walking in circles. You may not remember the seizure or even know that it occurred. Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. These seizures may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound, but you don\\'t lose consciousness. You may suddenly feel angry, joyful or sad. Some people have nausea or unusual feelings that are difficult to describe. These seizures may also result in difficulty speaking, involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or a leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Different types of generalized seizures include: Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or by subtle body movements, such as eye blinking or lip smacking. They usually last for five to 10 seconds but may happen up to hundreds of times per day. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to lose consciousness and fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse, fall down or drop your head. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. There is often no loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. They may last for several minutes. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn\\'t return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You\\'re experiencing heat exhaustion. You\\'re pregnant. You have diabetes. You\\'ve injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. @font-face {\\n\\t\\t\\tfont-family: mayo-form-icons;\\n\\t\\t\\tsrc:

Experts currently believe that CTE symptoms appear in two forms. In early life between the late 20s and early 30s, the first form of CTE may cause mental health and behavioral issues including depression, anxiety, impulsivity and aggression. The second form of CTE is thought to cause symptoms later in life, around age 60. These signs and symptoms include memory and thinking problems that are likely to progress to dementia. The full list of signs to look for in people with CTE at autopsy is still unknown. It is unclear what kind of symptoms, if any, CTE may cause during life. Little is known right now about how CTE progresses. When to see a doctor CTE is thought to develop over many years after repeated brain injuries that may be mild or severe. However, see your doctor in case of the following: Suicidal thoughts. Research shows that people with CTE may be at increased risk of suicide.

       "  'symptoms': \"Many people with Chiari malformation have no signs or symptoms and don't need treatment. Their condition is detected only when tests are performed for unrelated disorders. However, depending on the type and severity, Chiari malformation can cause a number of problems. The more common types of Chiari malformation are: Type 1 Type 2 Although these types are less serious than the rarer pediatric form, type 3, signs and symptoms still can be life disrupting. Chiari malformation type 1 In Chiari malformation type 1, signs and symptoms usually appear during late childhood or adulthood. Headaches, often severe, are the classic symptom of Chiari malformation. They generally occur after sudden coughing, sneezing or straining. People with Chiari malformation type 1 can also experience: Neck pain Unsteady gait (problems with balance) Poor hand coordination (fine motor skills) Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet Dizziness Difficulty swallowing, sometimes accompanied by gagging, choking and vomiting Speech problems, such as hoarseness Less often, people with Chiari malformation may experience: Ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus) Weakness Slow heart rhythm Curvature of the spine (scoliosis) related to spinal cord impairment Breathing problems, such as central sleep apnea, which is when a person stops breathing during sleep Chiari malformation type 2 In Chiari malformation type 2, a greater amount of tissue extends into the spinal canal compared with that in Chiari malformation type 1. The signs and symptoms can include those related to a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele that nearly always accompanies Chiari malformation type 2. In myelomeningocele, the backbone and the spinal canal don't close properly before birth. Signs and symptoms may include: Changes in breathing pattern Swallowing problems, such as gagging Quick downward eye movements Weakness in the arms Chiari malformation type 2 is usually noted with ultrasound during pregnancy. It may also be diagnosed after birth or in early infancy. Chiari malformation type 3 In the most severe type of the condition, Chiari malformation type 3, a portion of the lower back part of the brain (cerebellum) or the brainstem extends through an opening in the back of the skull. This form of Chiari malformation is diagnosed at birth or with an ultrasound during pregnancy. This type of Chiari malformation has a higher mortality rate and may also cause neurological problems. When to see a doctor If you or your child has any of the signs and symptoms that may be associated with Chiari malformation, see your doctor for an evaluation. Because many symptoms of Chiari malformation can also be associated with other disorders, a thorough medical evaluation is important. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

But groin pain occurs in the fold of skin between the thigh and abdomen — not in the testicle. The causes of groin pain are different from the causes of testicle pain. When to see a doctor If you have pain or swelling in your scrotum, especially if the pain occurs suddenly, see your doctor right away. A number of conditions can cause testicle pain, and some require immediate treatment. One such condition involves twisting of the spermatic cord (testicular torsion), which might cause pain similar to that caused by orchitis. Your doctor can perform tests to determine which condition is causing your pain. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic '},\n",

       "  'symptoms': \"Most healthy people who are infected with CMV may experience no symptoms. Some experience minor symptoms. People who are more likely to experience signs and symptoms of CMV include: Newborns who became infected with CMV before they were born (congenital CMV ). Infants who become infected during birth or shortly afterward (perinatal CMV ). This group includes babies infected through breast milk. People who have weakened immune systems, such as those who have had an organ, bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or those who are infected with HIV. Babies Most babies who have congenital CMV appear healthy at birth. A few babies who have congenital CMV who appear healthy at birth develop signs over time — sometimes not for months or years after birth. The most common of these late-occurring signs are hearing loss and developmental delay. A small number of babies may also develop vision problems. The following signs and symptoms are more common in babies who have congenital CMV and who are sick at birth: Premature birth Low birth weight Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) Enlarged and poorly functioning liver Purple skin splotches or a rash or both Abnormally small head (microencephaly) Enlarged spleen Pneumonia Seizures People who have weakened immunity If your immune system is weakened, you might experience serious problems that affect your: Eyes Lungs Liver Esophagus Stomach Intestines Brain Healthy adults Most people who are infected with CMV who are otherwise healthy experience few if any symptoms. When first infected, some adults may have symptoms similar to infectious mononucleosis, including: Fatigue Fever Sore throat Muscle aches When to see a doctor See your doctor if: You have a weakened immune system and you're experiencing symptoms of CMV infection. For people who have weakened immune systems, CMV infection can be serious or even fatal. People who have undergone stem cell or organ transplants seem to be at greatest risk. You develop a mononucleosis-like illness while you're pregnant. If you have CMV but are otherwise healthy, and you're experiencing any mild, generalized illness, you could be in a reactivation period. Self-care, such as getting plenty of rest, should be enough for your body to control the infection. When your child should see a doctor If you know you were infected with CMV during your pregnancy, tell your baby's doctor. The doctor will likely assess your baby for hearing or vision problems.

       " {'illness': 'Bipolar disorder',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired Increased activity, energy or agitation Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) Decreased need for sleep Unusual talkativeness Racing thoughts Distractibility Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all — or almost all — activities Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) Either insomnia or sleeping too much Either restlessness or slowed behavior Fatigue or loss of energy Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out — and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number — in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Seek help from your primary care provider or other health care professional. Call a mental health professional. Call a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or use their webchat on suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat. Reach out to a close friend or loved one.

PKU signs and symptoms can be mild or severe and may include: A musty odor in the breath, skin or urine, caused by too much phenylalanine in the body Neurological problems that may include seizures Skin rashes (eczema) Fair skin and blue eyes, because phenylalanine can't transform into melanin — the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone Abnormally small head (microcephaly) Hyperactivity Intellectual disability Delayed development Behavioral, emotional and social problems Psychiatric disorders Severity varies The severity of PKU depends on the type. Classic PKU. The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU. The enzyme needed to convert phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced, resulting in high levels of phenylalanine and severe brain damage. Less severe forms of PKU. In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme retains some function, so phenylalanine levels are not as high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage. But most children with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications. Pregnancy and PKU Women who have PKU and become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal PKU. If women don't follow the special PKU diet before and during pregnancy, blood phenylalanine levels can become high and harm the developing fetus or cause a miscarriage. Even women with less severe forms of PKU may place their unborn children at risk by not following the PKU diet. Babies born to mothers with high phenylalanine levels don't often inherit PKU. But they can have serious consequences if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mother's blood during pregnancy. Complications at birth may include: Low birth weight Delayed development Facial abnormalities Abnormally small head Heart defects and other heart problems Intellectual disability Behavioral problems When to see a doctor Seek medical advice in these situations: Newborns. If routine newborn screening tests show that your baby may have PKU, your child's doctor will want to start dietary treatment right away to prevent long-term problems. Women of childbearing years. It's especially important for women with a history of PKU to see a doctor and maintain the PKU diet before becoming pregnant and during pregnancy to reduce the risk of high blood phenylalanine levels harming their unborn babies. Adults. People with PKU continue to receive care across the life span. Adults with PKU who have stopped the PKU diet in their teens may benefit from a visit with their doctors. Returning to the diet may improve mental functioning and behavior and slow damage to the central nervous system that can result from high phenylalanine levels.

He or she can determine the degree of your farsightedness and advise you of options to correct your vision. Since it may not always be readily apparent that you're having trouble with your vision, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends the following intervals for regular eye exams: Adults If you're at high risk of certain eye diseases, such as glaucoma, get a dilated eye exam every one to two years, starting at age 40. If you don't wear glasses or contacts, have no symptoms of eye trouble, and are at a low risk of developing eye diseases, such as glaucoma, get an eye exam at the following intervals: An initial exam at 40 Every two to four years between ages 40 and 54 Every one to three years between ages 55 and 64 Every one to two years beginning at age 65 If you wear glasses or contacts or you have a health condition that affects the eyes, such as diabetes, you'll likely need to have your eyes checked regularly. Ask your eye doctor how frequently you need to schedule your appointments. But, if you notice problems with your vision, schedule an appointment with your eye doctor as soon as possible, even if you've recently had an eye exam. Blurred vision, for example, may suggest you need a prescription change, or it could be a sign of another problem. Children and adolescents Children need to be screened for eye disease and have their vision tested by a pediatrician, an ophthalmologist, an optometrist or another trained screener at the following ages and intervals.

Some people, however, develop signs and symptoms similar to those of the flu, including: Body aches Swollen lymph nodes Headache Fever Fatigue In people with weakened immune systems If you have HIV / AIDS, are receiving chemotherapy or have recently had an organ transplant, a previous toxoplasma infection may reactivate. In that case, you may develop more-severe signs and symptoms of infection, including: Headache Confusion Poor coordination Seizures Lung problems that may resemble tuberculosis or Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, a common opportunistic infection that occurs in people with AIDS Blurred vision caused by severe inflammation of your retina (ocular toxoplasmosis) In babies If you become infected for the first time just before or during your pregnancy, you can pass the infection to your baby (congenital toxoplasmosis), even if you don't have signs and symptoms yourself. Your baby is most at risk of contracting toxoplasmosis if you become infected in the third trimester and least at risk if you become infected during the first trimester. On the other hand, the earlier in your pregnancy the infection occurs, the more serious the outcome for your baby. Many early infections end in stillbirth or miscarriage. Infants who survive are likely to be born with serious problems, such as: Seizures An enlarged liver and spleen Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Severe eye infections Only a small number of babies who have toxoplasmosis show signs of the disease at birth. Often, infants who are infected don't develop signs — which may include hearing loss, mental disability or serious eye infections — until their teens or later. When to see a doctor If you are living with HIV or AIDS or are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor about being tested if you think you may have been exposed to toxoplasmosis.

In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about three to six hours after exposure. Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb; organ meats; and products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products, can cause a reaction. Signs and symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include: Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin (eczema) Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts Wheezing or shortness of breath A runny nose Stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting Sneezing Headaches A severe, potentially deadly allergic reaction that restricts breathing(anaphylaxis) Doctors think the time delay between eating red meat and developing an allergic reaction is one reason the condition was overlooked until recently. A possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight was far from obvious. When to see a doctor See your primary care doctor or a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies (allergist) if you experience food allergy symptoms after eating — even several hours after eating.

Less commonly, people with the opposite pattern have symptoms that begin in spring or summer. In either case, symptoms may start out mild and become more severe as the season progresses. Signs and symptoms of SAD may include: Feeling listless, sad or down most of the day, nearly every day Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed Having low energy and feeling sluggish Having problems with sleeping too much Experiencing carbohydrate cravings, overeating and weight gain Having difficulty concentrating Feeling hopeless, worthless or guilty Having thoughts of not wanting to live Fall and winter SAD Symptoms specific to winter-onset SAD, sometimes called winter depression, may include: Oversleeping Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates Weight gain Tiredness or low energy Spring and summer SAD Symptoms specific to summer-onset seasonal affective disorder, sometimes called summer depression, may include: Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Poor appetite Weight loss Agitation or anxiety Increased irritability Seasonal changes and bipolar disorder People who have bipolar disorder are at increased risk of seasonal affective disorder. In some people with bipolar disorder, episodes of mania may be linked to a specific season. For example, spring and summer can bring on symptoms of mania or a less intense form of mania (hypomania), anxiety, agitation and irritability. They may also experience depression during the fall and winter months. When to see a doctor It's normal to have some days when you feel down. But if you feel down for days at a time and you can't get motivated to do activities you normally enjoy, see your health care provider.

       "  'symptoms': \"The signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism usually develop gradually and get worse over time. They are sometimes subtle and may be overlooked for months or even years. But for some people, signs and symptoms develop suddenly. Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person, depending on which pituitary hormones are affected and to what degree. In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency, the second deficiency may increase or, in some cases, hide the symptoms of the first deficiency. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children, GH deficiency may cause growth problems and short stature. Most adults who have GH deficiency don't have any symptoms, but for some adults it can cause: Fatigue Muscle weakness Changes in body fat composition Lack of ambition Social isolation Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency Deficiency of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affect the reproductive system. In women, the deficiency decreases egg and estrogen production from the ovaries. In men, the deficiency decreases sperm and testosterone production from the testicles. Women and men may experience a lower sex drive, infertility or fatigue. In children and adolescents, delayed puberty is usually the only symptom. Women may also have symptoms such as: Hot flashes Irregular or no periods Loss of pubic hair An inability to produce milk for breast-feeding Men may also have symptoms such as: Erectile dysfunction Decreased facial or body hair Mood changes Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency This hormone controls the thyroid gland. A TSH deficiency leads to low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). This causes symptoms such as: Fatigue Weight gain Dry skin Constipation Sensitivity to cold or difficulty staying warm Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency This hormone helps your adrenal glands work properly, and helps your body react to stress. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include: Severe fatigue Low blood pressure, which may lead to fainting Frequent and prolonged infections Nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain Confusion Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency This hormone, which is also called vasopressin, helps your body balance its fluid levels. An ADH deficiency can cause a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause: Excessive urination Extreme thirst Electrolyte imbalances Prolactin deficiency Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk. Low levels of prolactin can cause women to have problems making milk for breast-feeding. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you develop any of the signs and symptoms associated with hypopituitarism. Contact your doctor immediately if signs or symptoms of hypopituitarism develop suddenly or are associated with a severe headache, visual disturbances, confusion or a drop in blood pressure. These could be signs and symptoms of sudden destruction of the pituitary gland tissue (pituitary apoplexy), often caused by bleeding into the pituitary gland.

The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp and buttocks. This condition is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the skin condition might not cause digestive symptoms. Doctors treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medication, or both, to control the rash. When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if you have diarrhea or digestive discomfort that lasts for more than two weeks. Consult your child's doctor if your child is pale, irritable or failing to grow or has a potbelly and foul-smelling, bulky stools. Be sure to consult your doctor before trying a gluten-free diet. If you stop or even reduce the amount of gluten you eat before you're tested for celiac disease, you can change the test results. Celiac disease tends to run in families. If someone in your family has the condition, ask your doctor if you should be tested. Also ask your doctor about testing if you or someone in your family has a risk factor for celiac disease, such as type 1 diabetes.

It may get darker or lighter with age. Vein malformations. These include swollen, twisted veins (varicose veins), usually on the surface of the legs. Deeper malformed veins in the arms, legs, abdomen and pelvis also can occur. There may be spongy tissue filled with small veins in or under the skin. Malformed veins may become more prominent with age. Overgrowth of bones and soft tissue. This begins in infancy and may be limited to one leg, but it can occur in an arm or, rarely, in the trunk or face. This overgrowth of bone and tissue creates a larger and longer extremity. Rarely, there may be fusion of fingers or toes or extra fingers or toes. Lymphatic system malformations. The lymphatic system — part of the immune system that protects against infection and disease and transports lymphatic fluid — can be malformed. Extra lymphatic vessels can be present that don't work properly and can lead to fluid leakage into the tissues and swelling. Other conditions.

Less severe injuries involve a stretching (B) of the nerve fibers or a rupture (C), where the nerve is torn into two pieces. Signs and symptoms of a brachial plexus injury can vary greatly, depending on the severity and location of your injury. Usually only one arm is affected. Less severe injuries Minor damage often occurs during contact sports, such as football or wrestling, when the brachial plexus nerves get stretched or compressed. These are called stingers or burners, and can produce the following symptoms: A feeling like an electric shock or a burning sensation shooting down your arm Numbness and weakness in your arm These symptoms usually last only a few seconds or minutes, but in some people the symptoms may linger for days or longer. More-severe injuries More-severe symptoms result from injuries that seriously injure or even tear or rupture the nerves. The most serious brachial plexus injury occurs when the nerve root is torn from the spinal cord. Signs and symptoms of more-severe injuries can include: Weakness or inability to use certain muscles in your hand, arm or shoulder Complete lack of movement and feeling in your arm, including your shoulder and hand Severe pain When to see a doctor Brachial plexus injuries can cause permanent weakness or disability.

Most cases of cholera that cause symptoms cause mild or moderate diarrhea that's often hard to tell apart from diarrhea caused by other problems. Others develop more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection. Symptoms of cholera infection can include: Diarrhea. Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss — as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed. Nausea and vomiting. Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours. Dehydration. Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. A loss of 10% or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration. Signs and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability, fatigue, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry and shriveled skin that's slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold, little or no urinating, low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat. Dehydration can lead to a rapid loss of minerals in your blood that maintain the balance of fluids in your body. This is called an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolyte imbalance An electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious signs and symptoms such as: Muscle cramps. These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium, chloride and potassium. Shock. This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body. If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in minutes. When to see a doctor The risk of cholera is slight in industrialized nations. Even in areas where it exists you're not likely to become infected if you follow food safety recommendations. Still, cases of cholera occur throughout the world. If you develop severe diarrhea after visiting an area with active cholera, see your doctor. If you have diarrhea, especially severe diarrhea, and think you might have been exposed to cholera, seek treatment right away. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency that requires immediate care.

Instead, you are probably experiencing delayed ejaculation if the delay is causing distress or frustration, or if you have to stop sexual activity due to fatigue, physical irritation, loss of erection or a request from your partner. Often, men might have difficulty reaching orgasm during sexual intercourse or other sexual activities with a partner. Some men can ejaculate only when masturbating. Delayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms: Lifelong vs. acquired. With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity. Acquired delayed ejaculation occurs after a period of normal sexual functioning. Generalized vs. situational. Generalized delayed ejaculation isn't limited to certain sex partners or certain kinds of stimulation. Situational delayed ejaculation occurs only under certain circumstances. These categories help in diagnosing an underlying cause and determining what might be the most effective treatment.

       " {'illness': 'Priapism',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Priapism symptoms vary depending on the type of priapism. The two main types of priapism are ischemic priapism and nonischemic priapism. Ischemic priapism Ischemic priapism, also called low-flow priapism, is the result of blood not being able to leave the penis. Blood is trapped in the penis because it cannot flow out of the veins of the penis or there is a problem with the contraction of smooth muscles within the erectile tissue of the penis. Ischemic priapism is the more common type of priapism and requires immediate medical care to prevent complications caused by not getting enough oxygen to the penile tissue. Signs and symptoms include: Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Rigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis (glans) is soft Progressively worsening penile pain Stuttering priapism — also called recurrent or intermittent priapism — is a form of ischemic priapism. An uncommon condition, stuttering priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism. It occurs more often in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell disease). Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more-frequent and more-prolonged erections. Stuttering priapism may begin in childhood. Nonischemic priapism Nonischemic priapism, also known as high-flow priapism, occurs when blood flow through the arteries of the penis isn't working properly. However, the penile tissues continue to receive some blood flow and oxygen. Nonischemic priapism often occurs due to trauma. Signs and symptoms include: Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Erect but not fully rigid penile shaft Usually not painful When to see a doctor If you have an erection lasting more than four hours, you need emergency care. The emergency room doctor will determine whether you have ischemic priapism or nonischemic priapism. If you experience recurrent, persistent, painful erections that resolve on their own, see your doctor. You might need treatment to prevent further episodes.

       "  'symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear around 5 months of age. They vary from person to person and change over time. Signs and symptoms can include: Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving you with too few red blood cells. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen, causing fatigue. Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. Pain can also occur in your bones. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few weeks. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more pain crises a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes. Swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood flow to the hands and feet. Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage your spleen, leaving you more vulnerable to infections. Doctors commonly give infants and children with sickle cell anemia vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. Delayed growth or puberty. Red blood cells provide your body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes can become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina — the portion of the eye that processes visual images — and lead to vision problems. When to see a doctor Sickle cell anemia is usually diagnosed in infancy through newborn screening programs. If you or your child develops any of the following problems, see your doctor right away or seek emergency medical care: Fever. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of serious infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection. Unexplained episodes of severe pain, such as pain in the abdomen, chest, bones or joints. Swelling in the hands or feet. Abdominal swelling, especially if the area is tender to the touch. Pale skin or nail beds. Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyes. Signs or symptoms of stroke.

Schizotypal personality disorder vs. schizophrenia Schizotypal personality disorder can easily be confused with schizophrenia, a severe mental illness in which people lose contact with reality (psychosis). While people with schizotypal personality disorder may experience brief psychotic episodes with delusions or hallucinations, the episodes are not as frequent, prolonged or intense as in schizophrenia. Another key distinction is that people with schizotypal personality disorder usually can be made aware of the difference between their distorted ideas and reality. Those with schizophrenia generally can't be swayed away from their delusions. Despite the differences, people with schizotypal personality disorder can benefit from treatments similar to those used for schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder is sometimes considered to be on a spectrum with schizophrenia, with schizotypal personality disorder viewed as less severe.

Signs and symptoms usually develop within 5 to 10 days after starting a course of antibiotics. However, they may occur as soon as the first day or up to three months later. Mild to moderate infection The most common signs and symptoms of mild to moderate C. difficile infection are: Watery diarrhea three or more times a day for more than one day Mild abdominal cramping and tenderness Severe infection People who have a severe C. difficile infection tend to become dehydrated and may need to be hospitalized. C. difficile can cause the colon to become inflamed and sometimes form patches of raw tissue that can bleed or produce pus. Signs and symptoms of severe infection include: Watery diarrhea as often as 10 to 15 times a day Abdominal cramping and pain, which may be severe Rapid heart rate Dehydration Fever Nausea Increased white blood cell count Kidney failure Loss of appetite Swollen abdomen Weight loss Blood or pus in the stool C. difficile infection that is severe and sudden, an uncommon condition, may also cause intestinal inflammation leading to enlargement of the colon (also called toxic megacolon) and sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. People who have these conditions are admitted to the intensive care unit. When to see a doctor Some people have loose stools during or shortly after antibiotic therapy. This may be caused by C. difficile infection.

       " {'illness': 'Bee sting',\n",
       "  'symptoms': 'Bee stings can produce different reactions, ranging from temporary pain and discomfort to a severe allergic reaction. Having one type of reaction doesn\\'t mean you\\'ll always have the same reaction every time you\\'re stung or that the next reaction will necessarily be more severe. Mild reaction Most of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include: Instant, sharp burning pain at the sting site A red welt at the sting area Slight swelling around the sting area In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours. Moderate reaction Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a bit stronger reaction, with signs and symptoms such as: Extreme redness Swelling at the site of the sting that gradually enlarges over the next day or two Moderate reactions tend to resolve over five to 10 days. Having a moderate reaction doesn\\'t mean you\\'ll have a severe allergic reaction the next time you\\'re stung. But some people develop similar moderate reactions each time they\\'re stung. If this happens to you, talk to your doctor about treatment and prevention, especially if the reaction becomes more severe each time. Severe allergic reaction A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to bee stings is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect quickly develop anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin Difficulty breathing Swelling of the throat and tongue A weak, rapid pulse Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness or fainting Loss of consciousness People who have a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting have a 25% to 65% chance of anaphylaxis the next time they\\'re stung. Talk to your doctor or an allergy specialist about prevention measures such as immunotherapy (\"allergy shots\") to avoid a similar reaction in case you get stung again. Multiple bee stings Generally, insects such as bees and wasps aren\\'t aggressive and only sting in self-defense. In most cases, this results in one or perhaps a few stings. In some cases a person will disrupt a hive or swarm of bees and get multiple stings. Some types of bees — such as Africanized honeybees — are more likely than are other bees to swarm, stinging in a group. If you get stung more than a dozen times, the accumulation of venom may induce a toxic reaction and make you feel quite sick. Signs and symptoms include: Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Headache A feeling of spinning (vertigo) Convulsions Fever Dizziness or fainting Multiple stings can be a medical emergency in children, older adults, and people who have heart or breathing problems. When to see a doctor In most cases, bee stings don\\'t require a visit to your doctor. In more-severe cases, you\\'ll need immediate care. Call 911 or other emergency services if you\\'re having a serious reaction to a bee sting that suggests anaphylaxis, even if it\\'s just one or two signs or symptoms. If you were prescribed an emergency epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others), use it right away as your doctor directed. Seek prompt medical care if you\\'ve been swarmed by bees and have multiple stings.

Since factor V Leiden is a risk for developing blood clots in the leg or lungs, the first indication that you have the disorder may be the development of an abnormal blood clot. Some clots do no damage and disappear on their own. Others can be life-threatening. Symptoms of a blood clot depend on what part of your body is affected. A clot in a deep vein This is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which most commonly occurs in the legs. A DVT may not cause any symptoms. If signs and symptoms do occur, they can include: Pain Swelling Redness Warmth A clot that travels to your lungs Known as a pulmonary embolism, this occurs when a portion of a DVT breaks free and travels through the right side of your heart to your lung, where it blocks blood flow. This can be a life-threatening situation. Signs and symptoms may include: Sudden shortness of breath Chest pain when breathing in A cough that produces bloody or blood-streaked sputum Rapid heartbeat When to see a doctor Seek medical attention immediately if you have signs or symptoms of either a DVT or a pulmonary embolism.

Dengue fever causes a high fever — 104 F (40 C) — and any of the following signs and symptoms: Headache Muscle, bone or joint pain Nausea Vomiting Pain behind the eyes Swollen glands Rash Most people recover within a week or so. In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. This is called severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death. Warning signs of severe dengue fever — which is a life-threatening emergency — can develop quickly. The warning signs usually begin the first day or two after your fever goes away, and may include: Severe stomach pain Persistent vomiting Bleeding from your gums or nose Blood in your urine, stools or vomit Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising Difficult or rapid breathing Fatigue Irritability or restlessness When to see a doctor Severe dengue fever is a life-threatening medical emergency. Seek immediate medical attention if you've recently visited an area in which dengue fever is known to occur, you have had a fever and you develop any of the warning signs.

Sexual difficulties, including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems in men. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. Difficulty digesting food, such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heartburn, all due to changes in digestive function.

Laughter often turns to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing. The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded. Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect. When to see a doctor If you think you have PBA, talk to your doctor. If you have a neurological condition, you might already be treated by a doctor who can diagnose PBA. Helpful specialists include neuropsychologists, neurologists and psychiatrists.

Immediate signs and symptoms of milk allergy might include: Hives Wheezing Itching or tingling feeling around the lips or mouth Swelling of the lips, tongue or throat Coughing or shortness of breath Vomiting Signs and symptoms that may take more time to develop include: Loose stools or diarrhea, which may contain blood Abdominal cramps Runny nose Watery eyes Colic, in babies Milk allergy or milk intolerance? A true milk allergy differs from milk protein intolerance and lactose intolerance. Unlike milk allergy, intolerance doesn't involve the immune system. Milk intolerance requires different treatment from true milk allergy. Common signs and symptoms of milk protein intolerance or lactose intolerance include digestive problems, such as bloating, gas or diarrhea, after consuming milk or products containing milk. Anaphylaxis Milk allergy can cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction that narrows the airways and can block breathing. Milk is the third most common food — after peanuts and tree nuts — to cause anaphylaxis. If you or your child has a reaction to milk, tell your doctor, no matter how mild the reaction. Tests can help confirm milk allergy, so you can avoid future and potentially worse reactions. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and requires treatment with an epinephrine (adrenaline) shot (EpiPen, Adrenaclick, others) and a trip to the emergency room. Signs and symptoms start soon after milk consumption and can include: Constriction of airways, including a swollen throat that makes it difficult to breathe Facial flushing Itching Shock, with a marked drop in blood pressure When to see doctor See your doctor or an allergist if you or your child experiences milk allergy symptoms shortly after consuming milk. If possible, see your doctor during the allergic reaction to help the doctor make a diagnosis. Seek emergency treatment if you or your child develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.

Although many experience cramping during their menstrual periods, those with endometriosis typically describe menstrual pain that's far worse than usual. Pain also may increase over time. Common signs and symptoms of endometriosis include: Painful periods (dysmenorrhea). Pelvic pain and cramping may begin before and extend several days into a menstrual period. You may also have lower back and abdominal pain. Pain with intercourse. Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis. Pain with bowel movements or urination. You're most likely to experience these symptoms during a menstrual period. Excessive bleeding. You may experience occasional heavy menstrual periods or bleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding). Infertility. Sometimes, endometriosis is first diagnosed in those seeking treatment for infertility. Other signs and symptoms. You may experience fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea, especially during menstrual periods. The severity of your pain may not be a reliable indicator of the extent of your condition. You could have mild endometriosis with severe pain, or you could have advanced endometriosis with little or no pain. Endometriosis is sometimes mistaken for other conditions that can cause pelvic pain, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ovarian cysts. It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a condition that causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and abdominal cramping. IBS can accompany endometriosis, which can complicate the diagnosis. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms that may indicate endometriosis. Endometriosis can be a challenging condition to manage. An early diagnosis, a multidisciplinary medical team and an understanding of your diagnosis may result in better management of your symptoms.

       " {'illness': 'Pituitary tumors',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Sometimes they are identified incidentally on an imaging test such as an MRI or CT performed for some other reason. Pituitary tumors that make hormones (functioning) can cause a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the hormone they produce. The signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors that don't make hormones (nonfunctioning) are related to their growth and the pressure they put on other structures. Large pituitary tumors — those measuring about 1 centimeter (slightly less than a half-inch) or larger — are known as macroadenomas. Smaller tumors are called microadenomas. Because of the size of macroadenomas, they can put pressure on the normal pituitary gland and nearby structures. Signs and symptoms related to tumor pressure Signs and symptoms of pressure from a pituitary tumor may include: Headache Vision loss, particularly loss of peripheral vision Symptoms related to hormone level changes Deficiency Large tumors could cause hormonal deficiencies. Signs and symptoms include: Nausea and vomiting Weakness Feeling cold Less frequent or no menstrual periods Sexual dysfunction Increased amount of urine Unintended weight loss or gain Overfunctioning Functioning pituitary tumors cause an overproduction of hormones. Different types of functioning tumors in your pituitary gland cause specific signs and symptoms and sometimes a combination of them. Adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting (ACTH) tumors ACTH tumors produce the hormone adrenocorticotropin, which stimulates your adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. Cushing syndrome results from your adrenal glands producing too much cortisol. Possible signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome include: Fat accumulation around your midsection and upper back Exaggerated facial roundness Thinning of the arms and legs with muscle weakness High blood pressure High blood sugar Acne Bone weakening Bruising Stretch marks Anxiety, irritability or depression Growth hormone-secreting tumors These tumors produce excess growth hormone (acromegaly), which can cause: Coarsened facial features Enlarged hands and feet Excess sweating High blood sugar Heart problems Joint pain Misaligned teeth Increased body hair Children and adolescents might grow too fast or too tall. Prolactin-secreting tumors Overproduction of prolactin from a pituitary tumor (prolactinoma) can cause a decrease in normal levels of sex hormones — estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Excessive prolactin in the blood affects men and women differently. In women, prolactinoma might cause: Irregular menstrual periods Lack of menstrual periods Milky discharge from the breasts In men, a prolactin-producing tumor may cause male hypogonadism. Signs and symptoms can include: Erectile dysfunction Lowered sperm count Loss of sex drive Breast growth Thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors When a pituitary tumor overproduces thyroid-stimulating hormone, your thyroid gland makes too much of the hormone thyroxine. This is a rare cause of hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your body's metabolism, causing: Weight loss Rapid or irregular heartbeat Nervousness or irritability Frequent bowel movements Excessive sweating When to see a doctor If you develop signs and symptoms that might be associated with a pituitary tumor, see your doctor. Pituitary tumors often can be treated to return your hormone levels to normal and alleviate your signs and symptoms. If you know that multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) runs in your family, talk to your doctor about periodic tests that may help detect a pituitary tumor early.

       " {'illness': 'Tuberous sclerosis',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Tuberous sclerosis symptoms are caused by noncancerous growths (benign tumors), in parts of the body, most commonly in the brain, eyes, kidneys, heart, lungs and skin, although any part of the body can be affected. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the size or location of the overgrowth. Although the signs and symptoms are unique for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include: Skin abnormalities. Most people with tuberous sclerosis have patches of light-colored skin, or they may develop small, harmless areas of thickened, smooth skin or reddish bumps under or around the nails. Facial growths that begin in childhood and resemble acne also are common. Seizures. Growths in the brain may be associated with seizures, which can be the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm shows up as repetitive spasms of the head and legs. Cognitive disabilities. Tuberous sclerosis can be associated with developmental delays and sometimes intellectual disability or learning disabilities. Mental health disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also can occur. Behavioral problems. Common behavioral problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment. Kidney problems. Most people with tuberous sclerosis develop noncancerous growths on their kidneys, and they may develop more growths as they age. Heart issues. Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as the child gets older. Lung problems. Growths that develop in the lungs may cause coughing or shortness of breath, especially with physical activity or exercise. These benign lung tumors occur more often in women than in men. Eye abnormalities. Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). These noncancerous growths don't always interfere with vision. When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of tuberous sclerosis may be noticed at birth. Or the first signs and symptoms may become evident during childhood or even years later in adulthood.

As the disease progresses, memory impairments worsen and other symptoms develop. At first, a person with Alzheimer's disease may be aware of having difficulty remembering things and organizing thoughts. A family member or friend may be more likely to notice how the symptoms worsen. Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease lead to growing trouble with: Memory Everyone has occasional memory lapses, but the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease persists and worsens, affecting the ability to function at work or at home. People with Alzheimer's may: Repeat statements and questions over and over Forget conversations, appointments or events, and not remember them later Routinely misplace possessions, often putting them in illogical locations Get lost in familiar places Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects Have trouble finding the right words to identify objects, express thoughts or take part in conversations Thinking and reasoning Alzheimer's disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Multitasking is especially difficult, and it may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually, a person with Alzheimer's may be unable to recognize and deal with numbers. Making judgments and decisions Alzheimer's causes a decline in the ability to make reasonable decisions and judgments in everyday situations. For example, a person may make poor or uncharacteristic choices in social interactions or wear clothes that are inappropriate for the weather. It may be more difficult to respond effectively to everyday problems, such as food burning on the stove or unexpected driving situations. Planning and performing familiar tasks Once-routine activities that require sequential steps, such as planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game, become a struggle as the disease progresses. Eventually, people with advanced Alzheimer's often forget how to perform basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Changes in personality and behavior Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Problems may include the following: Depression Apathy Social withdrawal Mood swings Distrust in others Irritability and aggressiveness Changes in sleeping habits Wandering Loss of inhibitions Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen Preserved skills Many important skills are preserved for longer periods even while symptoms worsen. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories and reminiscing, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts. These skills may be preserved longer because they are controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease. When to see a doctor A number of conditions, including treatable conditions, can result in memory loss or other dementia symptoms. If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your doctor for a thorough assessment and diagnosis. If you are concerned about thinking skills you observe in a family member or friend, talk about your concerns and ask about going together to a doctor's appointment.

The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness. Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays. Raynaud's phenomenon Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma. Digestive problems Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include: Heartburn Difficulty swallowing Bloating Diarrhea Constipation Fecal incontinence Heart and lung problems When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage. Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart. When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

You may need an antibiotic or an antifungal medication to help control the condition. Types of folliculitis The two main types of folliculitis are superficial and deep. The superficial type involves part of the follicle, and the deep type involves the entire follicle and is usually more severe. Forms of superficial folliculitis include: Bacterial folliculitis. This common type is marked by itchy, white, pus-filled bumps. It occurs when hair follicles become infected with bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus (staph). Staph bacteria live on the skin all the time. But they generally cause problems only when they enter your body through a cut or other wound. Hot tub folliculitis (pseudomonas folliculitis). With this type you may develop a rash of red, round, itchy bumps one to two days after exposure to the bacteria that causes it. Hot tub folliculitis is caused by pseudomonas bacteria, which is found in many places, including hot tubs and heated pools in which the chlorine and pH levels aren't well-regulated. Razor bumps (pseudofolliculitis barbae). This is a skin irritation caused by ingrown hairs. It mainly affects men with curly hair who shave too close and is most noticeable on the face and neck. People who get bikini waxes may develop barber's itch in the groin area. This condition may leave dark raised scars (keloids). Pityrosporum (pit-ih-ROS-puh-rum) folliculitis. This type produces chronic, red, itchy pustules on the back and chest and sometimes on the neck, shoulders, upper arms and face. This type is caused by a yeast infection. Forms of deep folliculitis include: Sycosis barbae. This type affects males who have begun to shave. Gram-negative folliculitis. This type sometimes develops if you're receiving long-term antibiotic therapy for acne. Boils (furuncles) and carbuncles. These occur when hair follicles become deeply infected with staph bacteria. A boil usually appears suddenly as a painful pink or red bump. A carbuncle is a cluster of boils. Eosinophilic (e-o-sin-o-FILL-ik) folliculitis. This type mainly affects people with HIV/AIDS. Signs and symptoms include intense itching and recurring patches of bumps and pimples that form near hair follicles of the face and upper body.

       "  'symptoms': \"There are three types of neurofibromatosis, each with different signs and symptoms. Neurofibromatosis 1 Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is usually diagnosed during childhood. Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms include: Flat, light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spots are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing. Freckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling usually appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. Bone deformities. Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg. Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumors usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults. Learning disabilities. Impaired thinking skills are common in children who have NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height. Neurofibromatosis 2 Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Also known as vestibular schwannomas, these tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Signs and symptoms generally appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms can include: Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ears Poor balance Headaches Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. People who have NF2 may also develop other benign tumors. Signs and symptoms of these tumors can include: Numbness and weakness in the arms or legs Pain Balance difficulties Facial drop Vision problems or cataracts Seizures Headache Schwannomatosis This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between ages 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis causes tumors to develop on the cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves — but rarely on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, so people who have schwannomatosis don't experience the same hearing loss as people who have NF2. Symptoms of schwannomatosis include: Chronic pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling Numbness or weakness in various parts of the body Loss of muscle When to see a doctor See your doctor if you or your child develop signs or symptoms of neurofibromatosis.

Both migraine and sinusitis headache pain often gets worse when you bend forward. Migraine can also be accompanied by various nasal signs and symptoms — including congestion, facial pressure and a clear, watery nasal discharge. These are due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in a migraine attack. In fact, studies have shown that approximately 90% of people who see a doctor for sinus headaches are found to have migraines instead. Sinusitis, however, usually isn't associated with nausea or vomiting or aggravated by noise or bright light — all common features of migraines. Sinusitis usually occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection or cold and includes thick, discolored nasal mucus, decreased sense of smell, and pain in one cheek or upper teeth. Headaches due to sinus disease often last days or longer, and migraines most commonly last hours to a day or two.

Classic CAH Female infants who have classic CAH may have a condition known as ambiguous genitalia, in which the clitoris is enlarged or the genitals look more like those of a male child. Male infants who have classic CAH have normal appearing genitals. Both male and female infants can be seriously affected by a lack of cortisol, aldosterone or both. This is known as an adrenal crisis, and it can be life-threatening. The salt-losing form and simple-virilizing form of classic CAH cause children's bodies to produce an insufficient amount of cortisol. These children can have problems maintaining normal blood pressure, normal blood sugar and energy levels, and are more vulnerable to stress. An excess of the male sex hormones can result in short height and early puberty for both boys and girls. Signs and symptoms of classic CAH in children and adults include: Appearance of pubic hair at a very early age Rapid growth during childhood, but shorter than average final height Nonclassic CAH Often there are no symptoms of nonclassic CAH when a baby is born. The condition is not identified on routine infant blood screening and usually becomes evident in late childhood or early adulthood. Cortisol may be the only hormone that's deficient. Teenage and adult females who have nonclassic CAH may have normal appearing genitals at birth, but later in life, they may experience: Irregular or absent menstrual periods Masculine characteristics such as facial hair, excessive body hair and a deepening voice Severe acne In both females and males, signs of nonclassic CAH may also include: Early appearance of pubic hair Rapid growth during childhood, an advanced bone age and shorter predicted final height When to see a doctor Classic CAH is usually detected at birth through required newborn screening or when female babies have ambiguous genitalia.

       "  'symptoms': \"The two main features of amnesia are: Difficulty learning new information following the onset of amnesia (anterograde amnesia) Difficulty remembering past events and previously familiar information (retrograde amnesia) Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory — they can't retain new information. Recent memories are most likely to be lost, while more remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared. Someone may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents, but not be able to name the current president, know what month it is or remember what was for breakfast. Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness, attention span, judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder. Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss, but it also involves other significant cognitive problems that lead to a decline in daily functioning. A pattern of forgetfulness is also a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but the memory and other cognitive problems in MCI aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia. Additional signs and symptoms Depending on the cause of the amnesia, other signs and symptoms may include: False memories (confabulation), either completely invented or made up of genuine memories misplaced in time Confusion or disorientation When to see a doctor Anyone who experiences unexplained memory loss, head injury, confusion or disorientation requires immediate medical attention. A person with amnesia may not be able to identify his or her location or have the presence of mind to seek medical care.

       " {'illness': 'Noonan syndrome',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome vary greatly among individuals and may be mild to severe. Characteristics may be related to the specific gene containing the mutation. Facial features Facial appearance is one of the key clinical features that leads to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. These features may be more pronounced in infants and young children, but change with age. In adulthood, these distinct features become more subtle. Features may include the following: Eyes are wide-set and down-slanting with droopy lids. Irises are pale blue or green. Ears are low-set and rotated backward. Nose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and bulbous tip. Mouth has a deep groove between the nose and the mouth and wide peaks in the upper lip. The crease that runs from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth becomes deeply grooved with age. Teeth may be crooked, the inside roof of the mouth (palate) may be highly arched and the lower jaw may be small. Facial features may appear coarse, but appear sharper with age. The face may appear droopy and expressionless. Head may appear large with a prominent forehead and a low hairline on the back of the head. Skin may appear thin and transparent with age. Heart disease Many people with Noonan syndrome are born with some form of heart defect (congenital heart disease), accounting for some of the key signs and symptoms of the disorder. Some heart problems can occur later in life. Some forms of congenital heart disease associated with this disorder include: Valve disorders. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, the flap of tissue that separates the lower right chamber (ventricle) of the heart from the artery that supplies blood to the lungs (pulmonary artery). It's the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome, and it may occur alone or with other heart defects. Thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This is abnormal growth or thickening of the heart muscle that affects some people with Noonan syndrome. Other structural defects of the heart. The defects can involve a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect), narrowing of the artery that carries blood to the lungs for oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis), or narrowing of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carries blood from the heart to the body (aortic coarctation). Irregular heart rhythm. This can occur with or without structural heart abnormalities. Irregular heart rhythm occurs in the majority of people with Noonan syndrome. Growth issues Noonan syndrome can affect normal growth. Many children with Noonan syndrome don't grow at a normal rate. Issues may include the following: Birth weight will likely be normal, but growth slows over time. Eating difficulties may result in inadequate nutrition and poor weight gain. Growth hormone levels may be insufficient. The growth spurt that's usually seen during the teenage years may be delayed. But because this disorder causes bone maturity to be delayed, growth sometimes continues into the late teens. By adulthood, some people with Noonan syndrome may have normal height, but short stature is more common. Musculoskeletal issues Some common issues can include: An unusually shaped chest often with a sunken sternum (pectus excavatum) or raised sternum (pectus carinatum) Wide-set nipples Short neck, often with extra folds of skin (webbed neck) or prominent neck muscles (trapezius) Deformities of the spine Learning disabilities Intelligence isn't affected for most people with Noonan syndrome. However, individuals may have: An increased risk of learning disabilities and mild intellectual disability A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issues that are usually mild Hearing and vision deficits that may complicate learning Eye conditions A common sign of Noonan syndrome is abnormalities of the eyes and eyelids. These may include: Problems with the eye muscles, such as cross-eye (strabismus) Refractive problems, such as astigmatism, nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) Rapid movement of the eyeballs (nystagmus) Cataracts Hearing problems Noonan syndrome can cause hearing deficits due to nerve issues or to structural abnormalities in the inner ear bones. Bleeding Noonan syndrome can cause excessive bleeding and bruising due to clotting defects or having too few platelets. Lymphatic conditions Noonan syndrome can cause problems with the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from the body and helps fight infection. These problems: May show up before or after birth or develop in the teenage years or adulthood Can be focused in a particular area of the body or widespread Most commonly cause excess fluid (lymphedema) on the back of the hands or top of the feet Genital and kidney conditions Many people, especially males, with Noonan syndrome can have problems with the genitals and kidneys. Testicles. Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) are common in males. Puberty. Puberty may be delayed in both boys and girls. Fertility. Most females develop normal fertility. In males, however, fertility may not develop normally, often because of undescended testicles. Kidneys. Kidney problems are generally mild and occur in a fairly small number of people with Noonan syndrome. Skin conditions People with Noonan syndrome may have skin conditions, which most commonly are: Various problems that affect the color and texture of the skin Curly, coarse hair or sparse hair When to see a doctor The signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome can be subtle. If you suspect you or your child may have the disorder, see your primary care doctor or your child's pediatrician. You or your child may be referred to a geneticist or a cardiologist. If your unborn child is at risk because of a family history of Noonan syndrome, prenatal tests may be available. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",
       " {'illness': 'Albinism',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair, and eye color and vision. Skin The most recognizable form of albinism results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings. Skin coloring (pigmentation) and hair color can range from white to brown, and may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism. With exposure to the sun, some people may develop: Freckles Moles, with or without pigment — moles without pigment are generally pink-colored Large freckle-like spots (lentigines) Sunburn and the inability to tan For some people with albinism, skin pigmentation never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in pigmentation. Hair Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, reddish or brown. Hair color may also darken by early adulthood or stain from exposure to normal minerals in water and the environment, and appear darker with age. Eye color Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age. The lack of pigment in the colored part of the eyes (irises) makes the irises somewhat translucent. This means that the irises can't completely block light from entering the eye. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting. Vision Vision impairment is a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems and issues may include: Rapid, involuntary back-and-forth movement of the eyes (nystagmus) Head movements, such as bobbing or tilting the head, to try to reduce the involuntary eye movements and see better Inability of both eyes to stay directed at the same point or to move in unison (strabismus) Extreme nearsightedness or farsightedness Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Abnormal curvature of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye (astigmatism), which causes blurred vision Abnormal development of the retina, resulting in reduced vision Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways (misrouting of the optic nerve) Poor depth perception Legal blindness (vision less than 20/200) or complete blindness When to see a doctor At your child's birth, if the doctor notices a lack of pigment in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows, the doctor will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's pigmentation and vision. If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your doctor. Contact your doctor if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or chronic infections. These signs and symptoms may indicate the presence of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome or Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which are rare but serious disorders that include albinism.

Children with BEEC have one of the following: Epispadias. This is the least severe form of BEEC, in which the tube to expel urine (urethra) doesn't fully develop. Bladder exstrophy. This defect causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body. The bladder is also turned inside out. Usually, bladder exstrophy will involve organs of the urinary tract, as well as the digestive and reproductive systems. Defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitals, pelvic bones, final section of the large intestine (rectum) and opening at the end of the rectum (anus) can occur. Children with bladder exstrophy also have vesicoureteral reflux. This condition causes urine to flow the wrong way — from the bladder back up into the tubes that connect to the kidneys (ureters). Children with bladder exstrophy also have epispadias. Cloacal exstrophy. Cloacal exstrophy (kloe-A-kul EK-stroh-fee) is the most serious form of BEEC. In this condition, the rectum, bladder and genitals don't fully separate as the fetus develops. These organs may not be correctly formed, and the pelvic bones are affected as well. The kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected. Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal abnormalities, including spina bifida.

As it progresses, the skin on your palm might appear puckered or dimpled. A firm lump of tissue can form on your palm. This lump might be sensitive to the touch but usually isn't painful. In later stages of Dupuytren's contracture, cords of tissue form under the skin on your palm and can extend up to your fingers. As these cords tighten, your fingers might be pulled toward your palm, sometimes severely. The two fingers farthest from the thumb are most commonly affected, though the middle finger also can be involved. Only rarely are the thumb and index finger affected.

The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks. They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body. Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include: Painful muscle spasms and stiff, immovable muscles (muscle rigidity) in your jaw Tension of muscles around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin Painful spasms and rigidity in your neck muscles Difficulty swallowing Rigid abdominal muscles Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms). Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include: High blood pressure Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Fever Extreme sweating Localized tetanus This uncommon form of tetanus results in muscles spasms near the site of a wound. While it's usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus. Cephalic tetanus This rare form of tetanus results from a head wound. It results in weakened muscles in the face and spasms of the jaw muscles. It also can progress to generalized tetanus. When to see a doctor Tetanus is a life-threatening disease. If you have signs or symptoms of tetanus, seek emergency care. If you have a simple, clean wound — and you've had a tetanus shot within 10 years — you can care for your wound at home. Seek medical care in the following cases: You've not had a tetanus shot within 10 years. You are unsure of when you last had a tetanus shot. You have a puncture wound, a foreign object in your wound, an animal bite or a deep cut. Your wound is contaminated with dirt, soil, feces, rust or saliva — or you have any doubt about whether you've cleaned a wound sufficiently after such exposure. Contaminated wounds require a vaccination booster if it's been five or more years since your last tetanus shot. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic \"},\n",

Show transcript An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. \"A proportion of these patients will go on to have a rupture. And the challenge with rupture is that it\\'s unpredictable.\" Dr. Bernard Bendok says a ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency that can cause life-threatening bleeding in the brain. \"The typical presentation is somebody who has the worst headache of their life.\" Fast treatment is essential. It includes open surgery, or less-invasive options, such as sealing the ruptured artery from within the blood vessel with metal coils and/or stents. Dr. Bendok says 1 to 2 percent of the population have aneurysms, and only a small percentage of that group will experience a rupture. People who have a family history of aneurysms, have polycystic kidney disease, connective tissue disease, and people who smoke are at increased risk of rupture, and should consider screening.

       "  'symptoms': 'Not seeing or feeling a testicle where you would expect it to be in the scrotum is the main sign of an undescended testicle. Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the last couple of months of normal fetal development, the testicles gradually descend from the abdomen through a tube-like passageway in the groin (inguinal canal) into the scrotum. With an undescended testicle, that process stops or is delayed. When to see a doctor An undescended testicle is typically detected when your baby is examined shortly after birth. If your son has an undescended testicle, ask the doctor how often your son will need to be examined. If the testicle hasn\\'t moved into the scrotum by the time your son is 4 months old, the problem probably won\\'t correct itself. Treating an undescended testicle when your son is still a baby might lower the risk of complications later in life, such as infertility and testicular cancer. Older boys — from infants to pre-adolescent boys — who have normally descended testicles at birth might appear to be \"missing\" a testicle later. This condition might indicate: A retractile testicle, which moves back and forth between the scrotum and the groin and might be easily guided by hand into the scrotum during a physical exam. This is not abnormal and is due to a muscle reflex in the scrotum. An ascending testicle, or acquired undescended testicle, that has \"returned\" to the groin and can\\'t be easily guided by hand into the scrotum.

Most people who have Gaucher disease have varying degrees of the following problems: Abdominal complaints. Because the liver and especially the spleen can enlarge dramatically, the abdomen can become painfully distended. Skeletal abnormalities. Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures. It can also interfere with the blood supply to your bones, which can cause portions of the bone to die. Blood disorders. A decrease in healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result in severe fatigue. Gaucher disease also affects the cells responsible for clotting, which can cause easy bruising and nosebleeds. More rarely, Gaucher disease affects the brain, which can cause abnormal eye movements, muscle rigidity, swallowing difficulties and seizures. One rare subtype of Gaucher disease begins in infancy and typically results in death by 2 years of age.

       " {'illness': 'Narcolepsy',\n",
       "  'symptoms': \"The signs and symptoms of narcolepsy may worsen for the first few years and then continue for life. They include: Excessive daytime sleepiness. People with narcolepsy fall asleep without warning, anywhere, anytime. For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly you nod off, sleeping for a few minutes up to a half-hour. When you awaken, you feel refreshed, but eventually you get sleepy again. You may also experience decreased alertness and focus throughout the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness usually is the first symptom to appear and is often the most troublesome, making it difficult for you to concentrate and fully function. Sudden loss of muscle tone. This condition, called cataplexy (KAT-uh-plek-see), can cause a number of physical changes, from slurred speech to complete weakness of most muscles, and may last up to a few minutes. Cataplexy is uncontrollable and is triggered by intense emotions, usually positive ones such as laughter or excitement, but sometimes fear, surprise or anger. For example, when you laugh, your head may droop uncontrollably or your knees may suddenly buckle. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year, while others have numerous episodes daily. Not everyone with narcolepsy experiences cataplexy. Sleep paralysis. People with narcolepsy often experience a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. These episodes are usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes — but can be frightening. You may be aware of the condition and have no difficulty recalling it afterward, even if you had no control over what was happening to you. This sleep paralysis mimics the type of temporary paralysis that normally occurs during a period of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This temporary immobility during REM sleep may prevent your body from acting out dream activity. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy, however. Many people without narcolepsy experience some episodes of sleep paralysis. Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is typically when most dreaming happens. REM sleep can occur at any time of the day in people with narcolepsy. People with narcolepsy often transition quickly to REM sleep, usually within 15 minutes of falling asleep. Hallucinations. These hallucinations are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep and hypnopompic hallucinations if they occur upon waking. An example is feeling as if there is a stranger in your bedroom. These hallucinations may be particularly vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming and you experience your dreams as reality. Other characteristics People with narcolepsy may have other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea — a condition in which breathing starts and stops throughout the night — restless legs syndrome and even insomnia. Some people with narcolepsy experience automatic behavior during brief episodes of narcolepsy. For example, you may fall asleep while performing a task you normally perform, such as writing, typing or driving, and you continue to perform that task while asleep. When you awaken, you can't remember what you did, and you probably didn't do it well.

The rash gradually spreads over a period of days and can eventually reach up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually appear in stages, but the stages can overlap. Early signs and symptoms A small, red bump, similar to the bump of a mosquito bite, often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days. This normal occurrence doesn't indicate Lyme disease. However, these signs and symptoms can occur within a month after you've been infected: Rash. From three to 30 days after an infected tick bite, an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center, forming a bull's-eye pattern. The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. It's typically not itchy or painful but might feel warm to the touch. Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease, although not everyone with Lyme disease develops the rash. Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies. Other symptoms. Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, headache, neck stiffness and swollen lymph nodes can accompany the rash. Later signs and symptoms If untreated, new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months. These include: Erythema migrans. The rash may appear on other areas of your body. Joint pain. Bouts of severe joint pain and swelling are especially likely to affect your knees, but the pain can shift from one joint to another. Neurological problems. Weeks, months or even years after infection, you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis), temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy), numbness or weakness in your limbs, and impaired muscle movement. Less common signs and symptoms Several weeks after infection, some people develop: Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat Eye inflammation Liver inflammation (hepatitis) Severe fatigue When to see a doctor If you've been bitten by a tick and have symptoms Only a minority of tick bites leads to Lyme disease. The longer the tick remains attached to your skin, the greater your risk of getting the disease. Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours. If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease — particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is common — contact your doctor. Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early. See your doctor even if symptoms disappear Visit your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear — the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone. Untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body for several months to years after infection, causing arthritis and nervous system problems.
