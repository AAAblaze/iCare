It's normal to exhibit oppositional behavior at certain stages of a child's development. Signs of ODD generally begin during preschool years. Sometimes ODD may develop later, but almost always before the early teen years. These behaviors cause significant impairment with family, social activities, school and work. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, lists criteria for diagnosing ODD. The DSM-5 criteria include emotional and behavioral symptoms that last at least six months. Angry and irritable mood: Often and easily loses temper Is frequently touchy and easily annoyed by others Is often angry and resentful Argumentative and defiant behavior: Often argues with adults or people in authority Often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or rules Often deliberately annoys or upsets people Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior Vindictiveness: Is often spiteful or vindictive Has shown spiteful or vindictive behavior at least twice in the past six months ODD can vary in severity: Mild. Symptoms occur only in one setting, such as only at home, school, work or with peers. Moderate. Some symptoms occur in at least two settings. Severe. Some symptoms occur in three or more settings. For some children, symptoms may first be seen only at home, but with time extend to other settings, such as school and with friends. When to see a doctor Your child isn't likely to see his or her behavior as a problem. Instead, he or she will probably complain about unreasonable demands or blame others for problems. If your child shows signs that may indicate ODD or other disruptive behavior, or you're concerned about your ability to parent a challenging child, seek help from a child psychologist or a child psychiatrist with expertise in disruptive behavior problems.

This disorder usually results in the following: An average-size trunk Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers Limited mobility at the elbows A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose Progressive development of bowed legs Progressive development of swayed lower back An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm) Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include: A very short trunk A short neck Shortened arms and legs Average-size hands and feet Broad, rounded chest Slightly flattened cheekbones Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward A foot that's twisted or out of shape Instability of the neck bones Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine Progressive development of swayed lower back Vision and hearing problems Arthritis and problems with joint movement Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm) Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems. Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include: Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts Growth rate slower than expected for age Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism are often present at birth or in early infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not be immediately apparent. See your child's doctor if you have any concerns about your child's growth or overall development.

Worry about \"going crazy\" can cause you to become preoccupied with checking that you exist and determining what's actually real. Symptoms usually begin in the mid- to late teens or early adulthood. Depersonalization-derealization disorder is rare in children and older adults. Depersonalization symptoms Symptoms of depersonalization include: Feelings that you're an outside observer of your thoughts, feelings, your body or parts of your body \u2014 for example, as if you were floating in air above yourself Feeling like a robot or that you're not in control of your speech or movements The sense that your body, legs or arms appear distorted, enlarged or shrunken, or that your head is wrapped in cotton Emotional or physical numbness of your senses or responses to the world around you A sense that your memories lack emotion, and that they may or may not be your own memories Derealization symptoms Symptoms of derealization include: Feelings of being alienated from or unfamiliar with your surroundings \u2014 for example, like you're living in a movie or a dream Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about, as if you were separated by a glass wall Surroundings that appear distorted, blurry, colorless, two-dimensional or artificial, or a heightened awareness and clarity of your surroundings Distortions in perception of time, such as recent events feeling like distant past Distortions of distance and the size and shape of objects Episodes of depersonalization-derealization disorder may last hours, days, weeks or even months at a time. In some people, these episodes turn into ongoing feelings of depersonalization or derealization that may periodically get better or worse. When to see a doctor Passing feelings of depersonalization or derealization are common and aren't necessarily a cause for concern. But ongoing or severe feelings of detachment and distortion of your surroundings can be a sign of depersonalization-derealization disorder or another physical or mental health disorder. See a doctor if you have feelings of depersonalization or derealization that: Are disturbing you or are emotionally disruptive Don't go away or keep coming back Interfere with work, relationships or daily activities "}, {"illness": "Goiter", "img": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/35/ds00217_-ds00567_im00713_r7_goiternormalthu_jpg.jpg", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/goiter/symptoms-causes/syc-20351829", "symptoms": "Most people with goiters have no signs or symptoms other than a swelling at the base of the neck.

Sometimes, the swollen area might be smaller in the morning and larger later in the day. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you or your child experiences scrotal swelling. It's important to rule out other causes of the swelling that might require treatment. For example, a hydrocele might be associated with a weak point in the abdominal wall that allows a loop of intestine to extend into the scrotum (inguinal hernia). A baby's hydrocele typically disappears on its own. But if your baby's hydrocele doesn't disappear after a year or if it enlarges, ask your child's doctor to examine the hydrocele again. Get immediate medical treatment if you or your child develops sudden, severe scrotal pain or swelling, especially within several hours of an injury to the scrotum.

Expressive aphasia. This is also called Broca's or nonfluent aphasia. People with this pattern of aphasia may understand what other people say better than they can speak. People with this pattern of aphasia struggle to get words out, speak in very short sentences and omit words. A person might say, \"Want food\" or \"Walk park today.\" A listener can usually understand the meaning, but people with this aphasia pattern are often aware of their difficulty communicating and may get frustrated. They may also have right-sided paralysis or weakness. Comprehensive aphasia. People with this pattern of aphasia (also called fluent or Wernicke's aphasia) may speak easily and fluently in long, complex sentences that don't make sense or include unrecognizable, incorrect or unnecessary words. They usually don't understand spoken language well and often don't realize that others can't understand them. Global aphasia.

Primary infection (Acute HIV) Some people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within two to four weeks after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat and painful mouth sores Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck Diarrhea Weight loss Cough Night sweats These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In this stage of infection, HIV is still present in the body and in white blood cells. However, many people may not have any symptoms or infections during this time. This stage can last for many years if you're not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells \u2014 the cells in your body that help fight off germs \u2014 you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes \u2014 often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Pneumonia Progression to AIDS Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years. When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers \u2014 diseases that wouldn't usually cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include: Sweats Chills Recurring fever Chronic diarrhea Swollen lymph glands Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth Persistent, unexplained fatigue Weakness Weight loss Skin rashes or bumps When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a doctor as soon as possible.

The resulting signs and symptoms can include: Watery eyes (excessive tearing). Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids. Excessive dryness. Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy. Irritation. Stagnant tears or dryness can irritate your eyes, causing a burning sensation and redness in your eyelids and the whites of your eyes. Sensitivity to light.

"}, {"illness": "Epilepsy", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093", "symptoms": "Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion A staring spell Stiff muscles Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs Loss of consciousness or awareness Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. Some people experience deja vu. This type of seizure may also result in involuntary jerking of one body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream. During a focal seizure with impaired awareness, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, typically occur in children. They're characterized by staring into space with or without subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking and only last between 5-10 seconds. These seizures may occur in clusters, happening as often as 100 times per day, and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiff muscles and may affect consciousness. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. Since this most often affects the legs, it often causes you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches and usually affect the upper body, arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking. They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You're pregnant. You have diabetes. You've injured yourself during the seizure. You continue to have seizures even though you've been taking anti-seizure medication. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice.

Below you'll find several examples. Marijuana, hashish and other cannabis-containing substances People use cannabis by smoking, eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. Cannabis often precedes or is used along with other substances, such as alcohol or illegal drugs, and is often the first drug tried. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\" A heightened sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Increased blood pressure and heart rate Red eyes Dry mouth Decreased coordination Difficulty concentrating or remembering Slowed reaction time Anxiety or paranoid thinking Cannabis odor on clothes or yellow fingertips Exaggerated cravings for certain foods at unusual times Long-term (chronic) use is often associated with: Decreased mental sharpness Poor performance at school or at work Reduced number of friends and interests K2, Spice and bath salts Two groups of synthetic drugs \u2014 synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones \u2014 are illegal in most states. The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable, as there is no quality control and some ingredients may not be known. Synthetic cannabinoids, also called K2 or Spice, are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked, but can be prepared as an herbal tea. Despite manufacturer claims, these are chemical compounds rather than \"natural\" or harmless products. These drugs can produce a \"high\" similar to marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\" Elevated mood An altered sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Extreme anxiety or agitation Paranoia Hallucinations Increased heart rate and blood pressure or heart attack Vomiting Confusion Substituted cathinones, also called \"bath salts,\" are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection. Despite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted, inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in dangerous health effects or even death. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Euphoria Increased sociability Increased energy and agitation Increased sex drive Increased heart rate and blood pressure Problems thinking clearly Loss of muscle control Paranoia Panic attacks Hallucinations Delirium Psychotic and violent behavior Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. They're often used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to \"switch off\" or forget stress-related thoughts or feelings. Barbiturates. Examples include phenobarbital and secobarbital (Seconal). Benzodiazepines. Examples include sedatives, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), clonazepam (Klonopin) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Hypnotics. Examples include prescription sleeping medications such as zolpidem (Ambien, Intermezzo, others) and zaleplon (Sonata). Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Drowsiness Slurred speech Lack of coordination Irritability or changes in mood Problems concentrating or thinking clearly Memory problems Involuntary eye movements Lack of inhibition Slowed breathing and reduced blood pressure Falls or accidents Dizziness Meth, cocaine and other stimulants Stimulants include amphetamines, meth (methamphetamine), cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others) and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Adderall XR, others). They are often used and misused in search of a \"high,\" or to boost energy, to improve performance at work or school, or to lose weight or control appetite. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Feeling of exhilaration and excess confidence Increased alertness Increased energy and restlessness Behavior changes or aggression Rapid or rambling speech Dilated pupils Confusion, delusions and hallucinations Irritability, anxiety or paranoia Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature Nausea or vomiting with weight loss Impaired judgment Nasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose (if snorting drugs) Mouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs (\"meth mouth\") Insomnia Depression as the drug wears off Club drugs Club drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties. Examples include ecstasy or molly (MDMA), gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), flunitrazepam (Rohypnol \u2015 a brand used outside the U.S. \u2015 also called roofie) and ketamine. These drugs are not all in the same category, but they share some similar effects and dangers, including long-term harmful effects. Because GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation, muscle relaxation, confusion and memory loss, the potential for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs. Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include: Hallucinations Paranoia Dilated pupils Chills and sweating Involuntary shaking (tremors) Behavior changes Muscle cramping and teeth clenching Muscle relaxation, poor coordination or problems moving Reduced inhibitions Heightened or altered sense of sight, sound and taste Poor judgment Memory problems or loss of memory Reduced consciousness Increased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure Hallucinogens Use of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug. The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP). LSD use may cause: Hallucinations Greatly reduced perception of reality, for example, interpreting input from one of your senses as another, such as hearing colors Impulsive behavior Rapid shifts in emotions Permanent mental changes in perception Rapid heart rate and high blood pressure Tremors Flashbacks, a re-experience of the hallucinations \u2014 even years later PCP use may cause: A feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings Hallucinations Problems with coordination and movement Aggressive, possibly violent behavior Involuntary eye movements Lack of pain sensation Increase in blood pressure and heart rate Problems with thinking and memory Problems speaking Impaired judgment Intolerance to loud noise Sometimes seizures or coma Inhalants Signs and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance. Some commonly inhaled substances include glue, paint thinners, correction fluid, felt tip marker fluid, gasoline, cleaning fluids and household aerosol products. Due to the toxic nature of these substances, users may develop brain damage or sudden death. Signs and symptoms of use can include: Possessing an inhalant substance without a reasonable explanation Brief euphoria or intoxication Decreased inhibition Combativeness or belligerence Dizziness Nausea or vomiting Involuntary eye movements Appearing intoxicated with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination Irregular heartbeats Tremors Lingering odor of inhalant material Rash around the nose and mouth Opioid painkillers Opioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. This class of drugs includes, among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone and oxycodone. Sometimes called the \"opioid epidemic,\" addiction to opioid prescription pain medications has reached an alarming rate across the United States. Some people who've been using opioids over a long period of time may need physician-prescribed temporary or long-term drug substitution during treatment. Signs and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include: Reduced sense of pain Agitation, drowsiness or sedation Slurred speech Problems with attention and memory Constricted pupils Lack of awareness or inattention to surrounding people and things Problems with coordination Depression Confusion Constipation Runny nose or nose sores (if snorting drugs) Needle marks (if injecting drugs) When to see a doctor If your drug use is out of control or causing problems, get help. The sooner you seek help, the greater your chances for a long-term recovery. Talk with your primary doctor or see a mental health professional, such as a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry, or a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Make an appointment to see a doctor if: You can't stop using a drug You continue using the drug despite the harm it causes Your drug use has led to unsafe behavior, such as sharing needles or unprotected sex You think you may be having withdrawal symptoms after stopping drug use If you're not ready to approach a doctor, help lines or hotlines may be a good place to learn about treatment. You can find these lines listed on the internet or in the phone book. When to seek emergency help Seek emergency help if you or someone you know has taken a drug and: May have overdosed Shows changes in consciousness Has trouble breathing Has seizures or convulsions Has signs of a possible heart attack, such as chest pain or pressure Has any other troublesome physical or psychological reaction to use of the drug Staging an intervention People struggling with addiction usually deny that their drug use is problematic and are reluctant to seek treatment. An intervention presents a loved one with a structured opportunity to make changes before things get even worse and can motivate someone to seek or accept help. An intervention should be carefully planned and may be done by family and friends in consultation with a doctor or professional such as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor, or directed by an intervention professional. It involves family and friends and sometimes co-workers, clergy or others who care about the person struggling with addiction. During the intervention, these people gather together to have a direct, heart-to-heart conversation with the person about the consequences of addiction and ask him or her to accept treatment.

This most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome is characterized by compression of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that come from your spinal cord and control muscle movements and sensation in your shoulder, arm and hand. Venous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone (clavicle) are compressed, resulting in blood clots. Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed, resulting in bulging of the artery, also known as an aneurysm. It's possible to have a mix of the three different types of thoracic outlet syndrome, with multiple parts of the thoracic outlet being compressed. Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are compressed, signs and symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include: Numbness or tingling in your arm or fingers Pain or aches in your neck, shoulder, arm or hand Weakening grip Signs and symptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include: Discoloration of your hand (bluish color) Arm pain and swelling Blood clot in veins in the upper area of your body Arm fatigue with activity Paleness or abnormal color in one or more fingers or your hand Throbbing lump near your collarbone Signs and symptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include: Cold fingers, hands or arms Hand and arm pain Lack of color (pallor) or bluish discoloration (cyanosis) in one or more of your fingers or your entire hand Weak or no pulse in the affected arm When to see a doctor See your doctor if you consistently experience any of the signs and symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome.

When to see a doctor Before travel Four weeks or more before your trip, make an appointment to see your doctor if you're traveling to an area in which yellow fever is known to occur so that you discuss whether you need the yellow fever vaccine. If you have less than four weeks to prepare, call your doctor anyway. Ideally, you'll be able to be vaccinated at least three to four weeks before traveling to an area where yellow fever occurs to give the vaccine time to work. Your doctor will help you determine whether you need vaccinations and can provide general guidance on protecting your health while abroad.

CAS can be associated with: Delayed onset of first words A limited number of spoken words The ability to form only a few consonant or vowel sounds These symptoms are usually noticed between ages 18 months and 2 years, and may indicate suspected CAS. As children produce more speech, usually between ages 2 and 4, characteristics that likely indicate CAS include: Vowel and consonant distortions Separation of syllables in or between words Voicing errors, such as \"pie\" sounding like \"bye\" Many children with CAS have difficulty getting their jaws, lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound, and they may have difficulty moving smoothly to the next sound. Many children with CAS also have language problems, such as reduced vocabulary or difficulty with word order. Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS and can be helpful to diagnose the problem. However, some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. It's difficult to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other types of speech or language disorders. Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. Those particularly associated with CAS include: Difficulty moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another Groping movements with the jaw, lips or tongue to make the correct movement for speech sounds Vowel distortions, such as attempting to use the correct vowel, but saying it incorrectly Using the wrong stress in a word, such as pronouncing \"banana\" as \"BUH-nan-uh\" instead of \"buh-NAN-uh\" Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying \"BUH-NAN-UH\" Separation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables Inconsistency, such as making different errors when trying to say the same word a second time Difficulty imitating simple words Inconsistent voicing errors, such as saying \"down\" instead of \"town\" Other characteristics are seen in most children with speech or language problems and aren't helpful in distinguishing CAS. Characteristics seen both in children with CAS and in children with other types of speech or language disorders include: Babbling less or making fewer vocal sounds than is typical between the ages of 7 to 12 months old Speaking first words late (after ages 12 to 18 months old) Using a limited number of consonants and vowels Frequently leaving out (omitting) sounds Using speech that is difficult to understand speech Other speech disorders sometimes confused with CAS Some speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the characteristics may overlap. These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders, phonological disorders and dysarthria. A child who has trouble learning how to make specific sounds, but doesn't have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak, may have an articulation or phonological disorder. Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS. Articulation or phonological speech errors may include: Substituting sounds, such as saying \"fum\" instead of \"thumb,\" \"wabbit\" instead of \"rabbit\" or \"tup\" instead of \"cup\" Leaving out (omitting) final consonants, such as saying \"duh\" instead of \"duck\" or \"uh\" instead of \"up\" Stopping the airstream, such as saying \"tun\" instead of \"sun\" or \"doo\" instead of \"zoo\" Simplifying sound combinations, such as saying \"ting\" instead of \"string\" or \"fog\" instead of \"frog\" Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that is due to weakness, spasticity or inability to control the speech muscles. Making speech sounds is difficult because the speech muscles can't move as far, as quickly or as strongly as normal. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice, or slurred or slow speech. Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. However, when dysarthria is caused by damage to certain areas of the brain that affect coordination, it can be difficult to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria.

You usually won't have atherosclerosis symptoms until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't supply enough blood to your organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow, or even breaks apart and can trigger a heart attack or stroke. Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example: If you have atherosclerosis in your heart arteries, you may have symptoms, such as chest pain or pressure (angina). If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your brain, you may have signs and symptoms such as sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These signal a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which, if left untreated, may progress to a stroke. If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have signs or symptoms of peripheral artery disease, such as leg pain when walking (claudication) or decreased blood pressure in an affected limb. If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your kidneys, you develop high blood pressure or kidney failure. When to see a doctor If you think you have atherosclerosis, talk to your doctor. Also pay attention to early symptoms of inadequate blood flow, such as chest pain (angina), leg pain or numbness.

Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain. Some people have no symptoms. For others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest. However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the chance you're having a heart attack. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning might be recurrent chest pain or pressure (angina) that's triggered by activity and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart. When to see a doctor Act immediately. Some people wait too long because they don't recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps: Call for emergency medical help. If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk. Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor. Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help. Take aspirin, if recommended. Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don't take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first. What to do if you see someone who might be having a heart attack If you see someone who's unconscious and you believe is having a heart attack, first call for emergency medical help. Then check if the person is breathing and has a pulse. If the person isn't breathing or you don't find a pulse, only then should you begin CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm \u2014 about 100 to 120 compressions a minute.

You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, but they take up a great deal of time and interfere with your daily routine and social, school or work functioning. Obsession symptoms OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things. Obsessions often have themes to them, such as: Fear of contamination or dirt Doubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty Needing things orderly and symmetrical Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include: Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way Images of driving your car into a crowd of people Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public Unpleasant sexual images Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands Compulsion symptoms OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety. You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix. As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as: Washing and cleaning Checking Counting Orderliness Following a strict routine Demanding reassurance Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include: Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked Checking the stove repeatedly to make sure it's off Counting in certain patterns Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase Arranging your canned goods to face the same way Severity varies OCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it can start in childhood. Symptoms usually begin gradually and tend to vary in severity throughout life. The types of obsessions and compulsions you experience can also change over time. Symptoms generally worsen when you experience greater stress. OCD, usually considered a lifelong disorder, can have mild to moderate symptoms or be so severe and time-consuming that it becomes disabling. When to see a doctor There's a difference between being a perfectionist \u2014 someone who requires flawless results or performance, for example \u2014 and having OCD. OCD thoughts aren't simply excessive worries about real problems in your life or liking to have things clean or arranged in a specific way.

There are many types of phobias, and it's not unusual to experience a specific phobia about more than one object or situation.

People with the disorder go to great lengths to hide their deception, so it may be difficult to realize that their symptoms are actually part of a serious mental health disorder. They continue with the deception, even without receiving any visible benefit or reward or when faced with objective evidence that doesn't support their claims. Factitious disorder signs and symptoms may include: Clever and convincing medical or psychological problems Extensive knowledge of medical terms and diseases Vague or inconsistent symptoms Conditions that get worse for no apparent reason Conditions that don't respond as expected to standard therapies Seeking treatment from many different doctors or hospitals, which may include using a fake name Reluctance to allow doctors to talk to family or friends or to other health care professionals Frequent stays in the hospital Eagerness to have frequent testing or risky operations Many surgical scars or evidence of numerous procedures Having few visitors when hospitalized Arguing with doctors and staff Factious disorder imposed on another Factitious disorder imposed on another (previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy) is when someone falsely claims that another person has physical or psychological signs or symptoms of illness, or causes injury or disease in another person with the intention of deceiving others. People with this disorder present another person as sick, injured or having problems functioning, claiming that medical attention is needed. Usually this involves a parent harming a child. This form of abuse can put a child in serious danger of injury or unnecessary medical care. How those with factitious disorder fake illness Because people with factitious disorder become experts at faking symptoms and diseases or inflicting real injuries upon themselves, it may be hard for health care professionals and loved ones to know if illnesses are real or not. People with factitious disorder make up symptoms or cause illnesses in several ways, such as: Exaggerating existing symptoms. Even when an actual medical or psychological condition exists, they may exaggerate symptoms to appear sicker or more impaired than is true. Making up histories. They may give loved ones, health care professionals or support groups a false medical history, such as claiming to have had cancer or AIDS. Or they may falsify medical records to indicate an illness. Faking symptoms. They may fake symptoms, such as stomach pain, seizures or passing out. Causing self-harm. They may make themselves sick, for example, by injecting themselves with bacteria, milk, gasoline or feces. They may injure, cut or burn themselves. They may take medications, such as blood thinners or drugs for diabetes, to mimic diseases. They may also interfere with wound healing, such as reopening or infecting cuts. Tampering. They may manipulate medical instruments to skew results, such as heating up thermometers. Or they may tamper with lab tests, such as contaminating their urine samples with blood or other substances. When to see a doctor People with factitious disorder may be well aware of the risk of injury or even death as a result of self-harm or the treatment they seek, but they can't control their behaviors and they're unlikely to seek help. Even when confronted with objective proof \u2014 such as a videotape \u2014 that they're causing their illness, they often deny it and refuse psychiatric help. If you think a loved one may be exaggerating or faking health problems, it may help to attempt a gentle conversation about your concerns. Try to avoid anger, judgment or confrontation. Also try to reinforce and encourage more healthy, productive activities rather than focusing on dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors. Offer support and caring and, if possible, help in finding treatment. If your loved one causes self-inflicted injury or attempts suicide, call 911 or emergency medical help or, if you can safely do so, take him or her to an emergency room immediately.

You might experience: Irregular periods. As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause. Hot flashes and sleep problems. Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them. Mood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause. Vaginal and bladder problems. When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence. Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months. Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond. Loss of bone. With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis \u2014 a disease that causes fragile bones. Changing cholesterol levels. Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"bad\" cholesterol \u2014 which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"good\" cholesterol \u2014 decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease. When to see a doctor Some women seek medical attention for their perimenopausal symptoms. But others either tolerate the changes or simply don't experience symptoms severe enough to need attention. Because symptoms may be subtle and come on gradually, you may not realize at first that they're all connected to the same thing \u2014 hormone fluctuations of the menopausal transition.

A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include: Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment. Odontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes. Other types of cysts and tumors. These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others. When to see a doctor If you're concerned that you may have symptoms of a jaw tumor or cyst, talk with your primary care provider or dentist. Many times, jaw cysts and tumors do not have symptoms and are typically discovered on routine screening X-rays done for other reasons.

ADHD symptoms start before age 12, and in some children, they're noticeable as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood. ADHD occurs more often in males than in females, and behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive. There are three subtypes of ADHD : Predominantly inattentive. The majority of symptoms fall under inattention. Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive. The majority of symptoms are hyperactive and impulsive. Combined. This is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. Inattention A child who shows a pattern of inattention may often: Fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork Have trouble staying focused in tasks or play Appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly Have difficulty following through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork or chores Have trouble organizing tasks and activities Avoid or dislike tasks that require focused mental effort, such as homework Lose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils Be easily distracted Forget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores Hyperactivity and impulsivity A child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often: Fidget with or tap his or her hands or feet, or squirm in the seat Have difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situations Be on the go, in constant motion Run around or climb in situations when it's not appropriate Have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly Talk too much Blurt out answers, interrupting the questioner Have difficulty waiting for his or her turn Interrupt or intrude on others' conversations, games or activities Typical developmental behavior vs. ADHD Most healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It's typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and be unable to stick with one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest. The same is true of hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic \u2014 they often are still full of energy long after they've worn their parents out. In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings. Children who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends are likely struggling with something other than ADHD. The same is true of children who are hyperactive or inattentive at home, but whose schoolwork and friendships remain unaffected. When to see a doctor If you're concerned that your child shows signs of ADHD, see your pediatrician or family doctor. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, psychiatrist or pediatric neurologist, but it's important to have a medical evaluation first to check for other possible causes of your child's difficulties.

The main symptom is memory loss that's more severe than normal forgetfulness and that can't be explained by a medical condition. You can't recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic time. Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat, or more rarely, can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. It may sometimes involve travel or confused wandering away from your life (dissociative fugue). An episode of amnesia usually occurs suddenly and may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years. Dissociative identity disorder. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by \"switching\" to alternate identities. You may feel the presence of two or more people talking or living inside your head, and you may feel as though you're possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and characteristics, including obvious differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. People with dissociative identity disorder typically also have dissociative amnesia and often have dissociative fugue. Depersonalization-derealization disorder. This involves an ongoing or episodic sense of detachment or being outside yourself \u2014 observing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance as though watching a movie (depersonalization). Other people and things around you may feel detached and foggy or dreamlike, time may be slowed down or sped up, and the world may seem unreal (derealization). You may experience depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms, which can be profoundly distressing, may last only a few moments or come and go over many years. When to see a doctor Some people with dissociative disorders present in a crisis with traumatic flashbacks that are overwhelming or associated with unsafe behavior. People with these symptoms should be seen in an emergency room. If you or a loved one has less urgent symptoms that may indicate a dissociative disorder, call your doctor. Suicidal thoughts or behavior If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number \u2014 in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to reach a trained counselor.

A person with alcohol poisoning who is unconscious or can't be awakened is at risk of dying. Alcohol poisoning is an emergency If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning \u2014 even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms \u2014 seek immediate medical care. Here's what to do: Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning. Be prepared to provide information. If you know, be sure to tell hospital or emergency personnel the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when. Don't leave an unconscious person alone. Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may choke on his or her own vomit and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because he or she could choke. Help a person who is vomiting. Try to keep him or her sitting up. If the person must lie down, make sure to turn his or her head to the side \u2014 this helps prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake to prevent loss of consciousness. Don't be afraid to get help It can be difficult to decide if you think someone is drunk enough to warrant medical intervention, but it's best to err on the side of caution. You may worry about the consequences for yourself or your friend or loved one, particularly if you're underage. But the consequences of not getting the right help in time can be far more serious.

Cognitive disorders Cognitive impairments often associated with Huntington's disease include: Difficulty organizing, prioritizing or focusing on tasks Lack of flexibility or the tendency to get stuck on a thought, behavior or action (perseveration) Lack of impulse control that can result in outbursts, acting without thinking and sexual promiscuity Lack of awareness of one's own behaviors and abilities Slowness in processing thoughts or ''finding'' words Difficulty in learning new information Psychiatric disorders The most common psychiatric disorder associated with Huntington's disease is depression. This isn't simply a reaction to receiving a diagnosis of Huntington's disease. Instead, depression appears to occur because of injury to the brain and subsequent changes in brain function. Signs and symptoms may include: Feelings of irritability, sadness or apathy Social withdrawal Insomnia Fatigue and loss of energy Frequent thoughts of death, dying or suicide Other common psychiatric disorders include: Obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition marked by recurrent, intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors Mania, which can cause elevated mood, overactivity, impulsive behavior and inflated self-esteem Bipolar disorder, a condition with alternating episodes of depression and mania In addition to the above disorders, weight loss is common in people with Huntington's disease, especially as the disease progresses. Symptoms of juvenile Huntington's disease The start and progression of Huntington's disease in younger people may be slightly different from that in adults. Problems that often present early in the course of the disease include: Behavioral changes Difficulty paying attention Rapid, significant drop in overall school performance Behavioral problems Physical changes Contracted and rigid muscles that affect gait (especially in young children) Tremors or slight involuntary movements Frequent falls or clumsiness Seizures When to see a doctor See your doctor if you notice changes in your movements, emotional state or mental ability. The signs and symptoms of Huntington's disease can be caused by a number of different conditions. Therefore, it's important to get a prompt, thorough diagnosis.

Symptoms may slowly change over time from childhood to adulthood. Infants Signs and symptoms that may be present from birth include: Poor muscle tone. A primary sign during infancy is poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed, and they may feel floppy or like rag dolls when they're held. Distinct facial features. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip. Poor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone. Poor sucking makes feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive. Generally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem unusually tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry. Underdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicles may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In females, the clitoris and labia may be small. Early childhood to adulthood Other features of Prader-Willi syndrome appear during early childhood and remain throughout life, requiring careful management. These features may include: Food craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food, resulting in rapid weight gain, starting around age 2 years. Constant hunger leads to eating often and consuming large portions. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food, or eating frozen food or even garbage, may develop. Underdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organs (testes in men and ovaries in women) produce little or no sex hormones. This results in underdeveloped sex organs, incomplete or delayed puberty, and in nearly all cases, infertility. Without treatment, women may not start menstruating until their 30s or may never menstruate, and men may not have much facial hair and their voices may never fully deepen. Poor growth and physical development. Underproduction of growth hormone can result in short adult height, low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problems may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency, which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections. Cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate intellectual disability, such as issues with thinking, reasoning and problem-solving, is a common feature of the disorder. Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities. Delayed motor development. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestones in physical movement \u2014 for example, sitting up or walking \u2014 later than other children do. Speech problems. Speech is often delayed. Poor articulation of words may be an ongoing problem into adulthood. Behavioral problems. Children and adults may at times be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food, and may not tolerate changes in routine. They may also develop obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and skin picking, may develop. Sleep disorders. Children and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome may have sleep disorders, including disruptions of the normal sleep cycle and a condition in which breathing pauses during sleep (sleep apnea). These disorders can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and worsen behavior problems. Other signs and symptoms. These may include small hands and feet, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), hip problems, reduced saliva flow, nearsightedness and other vision problems, problems regulating body temperature, a high pain tolerance, or a lack of pigment (hypopigmentation) causing hair, eyes and skin to be pale. When to see a doctor Regularly scheduled well-baby visits can help identify early signs of poor growth and development, which can be signs of Prader-Willi syndrome or other disorders. If you have concerns about your baby's health between well-baby visits, schedule an appointment with your child's doctor.

The adults then produce larvae that migrate through various tissues, including muscle tissue, shown here. Signs and symptoms of trichinosis infection and their severity vary depending on the number of larvae consumed in the infected meat. Abdominal symptoms can occur one to two days after infection. Other symptoms usually start two to eight weeks after infection. Possibly no signs or symptoms Mild cases of trichinosis \u2014 those with only a small number of parasites in your body \u2014 may cause no recognizable signs or symptoms. Symptoms can develop with moderate or heavy infestation, sometimes progressing as the parasite travels through your body. Initial signs and symptoms You swallow trichinella larvae encased in a cyst. Your digestive juices dissolve the cyst, releasing the parasite into your body. The larvae then penetrate the wall of the small intestine, where they mature into adult worms and mate. At this stage, you may experience: Diarrhea Abdominal pain Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Later signs and symptoms About a week after infection, the adult female worms produce larvae that go through the intestinal wall, enter your bloodstream, and eventually burrow into muscle or other tissue. This tissue invasion can cause: High fever Muscle pain and tenderness Swelling of the eyelids or face Weakness Headache Sensitivity to light Pink eye (conjunctivitis) When to see a doctor If you have a mild case of trichinosis with no symptoms, you might not need medical attention.

During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include: Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain Anxiety, agitation or restlessness Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why. Depression symptoms in children and teens Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences. In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight. In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction. Depression symptoms in older adults Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as: Memory difficulties or personality changes Physical aches or pain Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex \u2014 not caused by a medical condition or medication Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men When to see a doctor If you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. When to get emergency help If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Call your doctor or mental health professional. Call a suicide hotline number \u2014 in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). Use that same number and press \"1\" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line. Reach out to a close friend or loved one. Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.

Signs and symptoms may last longer and be more severe if the condition is caused by certain bacteria or parasites. In such cases, you may need prescription medications to help you get better. If you're an adult, see your doctor if: Your diarrhea persists beyond two days You become dehydrated You have severe abdominal or rectal pain You have bloody or black stools You have a fever above 102 F (39 C) While traveling internationally, a local embassy or consulate may be able to help you find a well-regarded medical professional who speaks your language. Be especially cautious with children because traveler's diarrhea can cause severe dehydration in a short time.

Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes? It could be eye floaters. \"In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called 'the vitreous.' When we're young, it's a firm clump of jelly. As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces. Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floaters,\" says Dr. Khan. Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you're nearsighted. The biggest concern \u2013 they can cause retinal tears. \"If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall,\" says Dr. Khan. \"And that's a retinal detachment.\" And that can cause blindness, which is why it's especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision. Most eye floaters don't require treatment, but your eye doctor likely will recommend regular eye exams to ensure the condition doesn't worsen.

Differences in symptoms may make it difficult to pinpoint headache type in a child, especially in a younger child who can't describe symptoms. In general, though, certain symptoms tend to fall more frequently into certain categories. Migraine Migraines can cause: Pulsating or throbbing head pain Pain that worsens with activity Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Extreme sensitivity to light and sound Even infants can have migraines. A child who's too young to tell you what's wrong may cry or rock back and forth to indicate severe pain. Tension-type headache Tension-type headaches can cause: A pressing tightness in the muscles of the head or neck Mild to moderate, nonpulsating pain on both sides of the head Pain that's not worsened by physical activity Headache that's not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as is often the case with migraine Younger children may withdraw from regular play and want to sleep more. Tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to several days. Cluster headache Cluster headaches are uncommon in children under 10 years of age. They usually: Occur in groups of five or more episodes, ranging from one headache every other day to eight a day Involve sharp, stabbing pain on one side of the head that lasts less than three hours Are accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or restlessness or agitation Chronic daily headache Doctors use the phrase \"chronic daily headache\" (CDH) for migraines and tension-type headaches that occur more than 15 days a month. CDH may be caused by an infection, minor head injury or taking pain medications \u2014 even nonprescription pain medications \u2014 too often. When to see a doctor Most headaches aren't serious, but seek prompt medical care if your child's headaches: Wake your child from sleep Worsen or become more frequent Change your child's personality Follow an injury, such as a blow to the head Feature persistent vomiting or visual changes Are accompanied by fever and neck pain or stiffness Talk to your child's doctor if you're worried or have questions about your child's headaches.

Seek immediate medical help if you have shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or near fainting, and chest pain or discomfort. A type of arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure. Collapse can occur within seconds and soon the person's breathing and pulse will stop. If this occurs, follow these steps: Call 911 or the emergency number in your area. If there's no one nearby trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), provide hands-only CPR. Push hard and fast on the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute until paramedics arrive. You don't need to do rescue breathing. If you or someone nearby knows CPR, start CPR. CPR can help maintain blood flow to the organs until an electrical shock (defibrillation) can be given. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available nearby, have someone get the device and follow the instructions. An AED is a portable defibrillation device that can deliver a shock that may restart heartbeats. No training is required to operate an AED. The AED will tell you what to do.

Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events \u2014 even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive.

Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes? It could be eye floaters. \"In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called 'the vitreous.' When we're young, it's a firm clump of jelly. As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces. Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floaters,\" says Dr. Khan. Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you're nearsighted. The biggest concern \u2013 they can cause retinal tears. \"If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall,\" says Dr. Khan. \"And that's a retinal detachment.\" And that can cause blindness, which is why it's especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision. Most eye floaters don't require treatment, but your eye doctor likely will recommend regular eye exams to ensure the condition doesn't worsen.

"}, {"illness": "Childhood schizophrenia", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354483", "symptoms": "Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases. Early signs and symptoms Schizophrenia signs and symptoms in children and teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group. Early signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions. Thinking: Problems with thinking and reasoning Bizarre ideas or speech Confusing dreams or television for reality Behavior: Withdrawal from friends and family Trouble sleeping Lack of motivation \u2014 for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing Bizarre behavior Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation Recreational drug or nicotine use Emotions: Irritability or depressed mood Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation Strange anxieties and fears Excessive suspicion of others Later signs and symptoms As children with schizophrenia age, more typical signs and symptoms of the disorder begin to appear. Signs and symptoms may include: Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking. Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion \u2014 doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure. Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be: Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations Symptoms may be difficult to interpret When childhood schizophrenia begins early in life, symptoms may build up gradually. Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can't recognize what's wrong. Some early signs can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptoms of other mental or physical conditions. As time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable. Eventually, your child may develop the symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions and difficulty organizing thoughts. As thoughts become more disorganized, there's often a \"break from reality\" (psychosis) frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment with medication. When to see a doctor It can be difficult to know how to handle vague behavioral changes in your child. You may be afraid of rushing to conclusions that label your child with a mental illness. Your child's teacher or other school staff may alert you to changes in your child's behavior. Seek medical care as soon as possible if you have concerns about your child's behavior or development. Suicidal thoughts and behavior Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with schizophrenia. If you have a child or teen who is in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with him or her. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or if you think you can do so safely, take your child to the nearest hospital emergency room.

Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with: Female genitals Genitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female (ambiguous genitals) Underdeveloped male genitals Puberty Male hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development. It can hamper: Development of muscle mass Voice deepening Growth of body and facial hair Growth of the penis and testicles And it can cause: Excessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) Adulthood In adult males, hypogonadism can alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function. Early signs and symptoms might include: Decreased sex drive Decreased energy Depression Over time, men with hypogonadism can develop: Erectile dysfunction Infertility Decrease in hair growth on the face and body Decrease in muscle mass Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) Loss of bone mass (osteoporosis) Severe hypogonadism can also cause mental and emotional changes. As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women. These can include: Difficulty concentrating Hot flashes When to seek help See your health care provider if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism. Finding the cause of hypogonadism is an important first step to getting appropriate treatment.

Most infants with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave normally for the first six months. After that, signs and symptoms start to appear. The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity can vary greatly from child to child. Rett syndrome signs and symptoms include: Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than normal head size (microcephaly) is usually the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, delayed growth in other parts of the body becomes evident. Loss of normal movement and coordination. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk normally. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or may become rigid or spastic with abnormal movement and positioning. Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of speech. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Abnormal hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome typically develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements that may differ for each person. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing. Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time. Breathing problems. These include breath-holding, abnormally rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forceful exhalation of air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours, but breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or periodic breathing can occur during sleep. Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety. Other abnormal behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing. Cognitive disabilities. Loss of skills can be accompanied by a loss of intellectual functioning. Seizures. Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives. Multiple seizure types may occur and are accompanied by an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). Abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and increases with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe. Irregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death. Sleep disturbances. Abnormal sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming. Other symptoms. A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as thin, fragile bones prone to factures; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding. Stages of Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages: Stage I: early onset. Signs and symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which starts between 6 and 18 months of age and can last for a few months or a year. Babies in this stage may show less eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delays in sitting or crawling. Stage II: rapid deterioration. Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such as slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or crying for no apparent reason, problems with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication. Stage III: plateau. The third stage usually begins between the ages of 2 and 10 years and can last for many years. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may have limited improvement, with less crying and irritability, and some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2. Stage IV: late motor deterioration. This stage usually begins after the age of 10 and can last for years or decades. It's marked by reduced mobility, muscle weakness, joint contractures and scoliosis. Understanding, communication and hand skills generally remain stable or improve slightly, and seizures may occur less often. When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of Rett syndrome can be subtle in the early stages. See your child's doctor right away if you begin to notice physical problems or changes in behavior after apparently normal development, such as: Slowed growth of your child's head or other parts of the body Decreased coordination or mobility Repetitive hand movements Decreasing eye contact or loss of interest in normal play Delayed speech development or loss of previously acquired speech abilities Problem behavior or marked mood swings Any clear loss of previously gained milestones in gross motor or fine motor skills "}, {"illness": "Food poisoning", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-poisoning/symptoms-causes/syc-20356230", "symptoms": "Food poisoning symptoms vary with the source of contamination.

Your child might have only one indication, such as a lingering cough or chest congestion. It can be difficult to tell whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma. Periodic or long-lasting wheezing and other asthma-like symptoms can be caused by infectious bronchitis or another respiratory problem. When to see a doctor Take your child to see the doctor if you suspect he or she has asthma. Early treatment will help control symptoms and possibly prevent asthma attacks. Make an appointment with your child's doctor if you notice: Coughing that is constant, is intermittent or seems linked to physical activity Wheezing or whistling sounds when your child breathes out Shortness of breath or rapid breathing Complaints of chest tightness Repeated episodes of suspected bronchitis or pneumonia If your child has asthma, he or she may say things such as, \"My chest feels funny\" or \"I'm always coughing.\" Listen for coughing, which might not wake your child, when he or she is asleep. Crying, laughing, yelling, or strong emotional reactions and stress also might trigger coughing or wheezing. If your child is diagnosed with asthma, creating an asthma plan can help you and other caregivers monitor symptoms and know what to do if an asthma attack occurs. When to seek emergency treatment In severe cases, you might see your child's chest and sides pulling inward as he or she struggles to breathe. Your child might have an increased heartbeat, sweating and chest pain. Seek emergency care if your child: Has to stop in midsentence to catch his or her breath Is using abdominal muscles to breathe Has widened nostrils when breathing in Is trying so hard to breathe that the abdomen is sucked under the ribs when he or she breathes in Even if your child hasn't been diagnosed with asthma, seek medical attention immediately if he or she has trouble breathing. Although episodes of asthma vary in severity, asthma attacks can start with coughing, which progresses to wheezing and labored breathing.

They can appear on the genitals, in the pubic area or in the anal canal. In most cases, your body's immune system defeats an HPV infection before it creates warts. When warts do appear, they vary in appearance depending on which kind of HPV is involved: Genital warts. These appear as flat lesions, small cauliflower-like bumps or tiny stemlike protrusions. In women, genital warts appear mostly on the vulva but can also occur near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina. In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch or feel tender. Common warts. Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps and usually occur on the hands and fingers. In most cases, common warts are simply unsightly, but they can also be painful or susceptible to injury or bleeding. Plantar warts. Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of your feet. These warts might cause discomfort. Flat warts. Flat warts are flat-topped, slightly raised lesions. They can appear anywhere, but children usually get them on the face and men tend to get them in the beard area. Women tend to get them on the legs. Cervical cancer Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections, but cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an HPV infection. The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don't cause noticeable symptoms. Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is your best protection from cervical cancer. Because early cervical cancer doesn't cause symptoms, it's vital that women have regular screening tests to detect any precancerous changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. Current guidelines recommend that women ages 21 to 29 have a Pap test every three years. Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to continue having a Pap test every three years, or every five years if they also get the HPV DNA test at the same time. Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three normal Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no abnormal results.

They may contain hairs or become raised or wrinkled. Talk to your doctor about any change in the color or size of a mole or if itching, pain, bleeding or inflammation develops. Melanoma Melanoma Melanoma The first sign of melanoma is often a mole that changes size, shape or color. This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles Normal moles are generally a uniform color \u2014 such as tan, brown or black \u2014 with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter \u2014 the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders \u2014 characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea \u2014 the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera). An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any skin changes that seem unusual.

Anorexia also includes emotional and behavioral issues involving an unrealistic perception of body weight and an extremely strong fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. It may be difficult to notice signs and symptoms because what is considered a low body weight is different for each person, and some individuals may not appear extremely thin. Also, people with anorexia often disguise their thinness, eating habits or physical problems. Physical symptoms Physical signs and symptoms of anorexia may include: Extreme weight loss or not making expected developmental weight gains Thin appearance Abnormal blood counts Fatigue Insomnia Dizziness or fainting Bluish discoloration of the fingers Hair that thins, breaks or falls out Soft, downy hair covering the body Absence of menstruation Constipation and abdominal pain Dry or yellowish skin Intolerance of cold Irregular heart rhythms Low blood pressure Dehydration Swelling of arms or legs Eroded teeth and calluses on the knuckles from induced vomiting Some people who have anorexia binge and purge, similar to individuals who have bulimia. But people with anorexia generally struggle with an abnormally low body weight, while individuals with bulimia typically are normal to above normal weight. Emotional and behavioral symptoms Behavioral symptoms of anorexia may include attempts to lose weight by: Severely restricting food intake through dieting or fasting Exercising excessively Bingeing and self-induced vomiting to get rid of food, which may include the use of laxatives, enemas, diet aids or herbal products Emotional and behavioral signs and symptoms may include: Preoccupation with food, which sometimes includes cooking elaborate meals for others but not eating them Frequently skipping meals or refusing to eat Denial of hunger or making excuses for not eating Eating only a few certain \"safe\" foods, usually those low in fat and calories Adopting rigid meal or eating rituals, such as spitting food out after chewing Not wanting to eat in public Lying about how much food has been eaten Fear of gaining weight that may include repeated weighing or measuring the body Frequent checking in the mirror for perceived flaws Complaining about being fat or having parts of the body that are fat Covering up in layers of clothing Flat mood (lack of emotion) Social withdrawal Irritability Insomnia Reduced interest in sex When to see a doctor Unfortunately, many people with anorexia don't want treatment, at least initially. Their desire to remain thin overrides concerns about their health. If you have a loved one you're worried about, urge her or him to talk to a doctor. If you're experiencing any of the problems listed above, or if you think you may have an eating disorder, get help. If you're hiding your anorexia from loved ones, try to find a person you trust to talk to about what's going on.

The most commonly affected areas are the lower back, elbows, knees, legs, soles of the feet, scalp, face and palms. Most types of psoriasis go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a time or even going into remission. There are several types of psoriasis, including: Plaque psoriasis. The most common form, plaque psoriasis causes dry, raised, red skin patches (lesions) covered with silvery scales. The plaques might be itchy or tender, and there may be few or many. They usually appear on elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe cases may cause the nail to crumble. Guttate psoriasis. This type primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling lesions on the trunk, arms or legs. Inverse psoriasis. This mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis. This rare form of psoriasis causes clearly defined pus-filled lesions that occur in widespread patches (generalized pustular psoriasis) or in smaller areas on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover your entire body with a red, peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. Psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis causes swollen, painful joints that are typical of arthritis. Sometimes the joint symptoms are the first or only symptom or sign of psoriasis. And at times only nail changes are seen. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint. It can cause stiffness and progressive joint damage that in the most serious cases may lead to permanent joint damage.

Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include: Difficulty walking Difficulty maintaining balance Loss of muscle coordination Loss of muscle tone or weakness Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects Difficulty swallowing Slurred speech or stuttering Memory loss and other thinking (cognitive) impairment Vision problems Sleep disturbances Seizures Hallucinations Unusual involuntary movements Types of paraneoplastic syndromes Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include: Cerebellar degeneration. This is the loss of nerve cells in the area of the brain that controls muscle functions and balance (cerebellum). Signs and symptoms may include unsteady or impaired walking, lack of muscle coordination in your limbs, inability to maintain your trunk posture, dizziness, nausea, involuntary eye movement, double vision, difficulty speaking, or difficulty swallowing. Limbic encephalitis. This is inflammation affecting a region of the brain known as the limbic system, which controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions. People with this disorder may experience personality changes or mood disturbances, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness. Encephalomyelitis. This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There may be a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the area affected. Opsoclonus-myoclonus. This syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections. It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements (opsoclonus) and involuntary, chaotic muscle jerks (myoclonus) in your limbs and trunk. Stiff person syndrome. Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome is characterized by progressive, severe muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly affecting your spine and legs. It may also cause painful muscle spasms. Myelopathy. This term refers to a syndrome of injury limited to the spinal cord. Depending on the level of spinal cord injury, you may have changes in bowel and bladder function, and severe weakness and numbness up to a certain level in your body. If the level of injury includes your neck, you can have severe disability affecting all four limbs. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. This is a syndrome caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. Signs and symptoms include pelvic and lower extremity muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. Autonomic nervous system problems can include dry mouth and impotence. When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer. Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is also related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles and also characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control, including muscles in your face, eyes, arms and legs. The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well. When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland (thymoma). Neuromyotonia. Neuromyotonia \u2014 also known as Isaacs' syndrome \u2014 is characterized by abnormal impulses in nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerve hyperexcitability) that control muscle movement. These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a \"bag of worms,\" progressive stiffness, muscle cramps, slowed movement and other muscle impairments. Peripheral neuropathy. This condition refers to patterns of damage to nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of your body. When damage involves only the sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system, you can have pain and disturbances in sensation anywhere in your body. Dysautonomia. Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of signs and symptoms resulting from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions (autonomic nervous system), such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. When this part of the nervous system is affected, common symptoms are low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing. When to see a doctor The signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are similar to those of many conditions, including cancer, cancer complications and even some cancer treatments. But if you have any signs or symptoms suggesting a paraneoplastic syndrome, see your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and appropriate care can be extremely important.

If this occurs, do the following: Call 911 or the emergency number in your area. If you or someone nearby is well trained in CPR, start CPR. CPR can help maintain blood flow to the organs until an electrical shock (defibrillation) can be given. If you're not trained in CPR or worried about giving rescue breaths, then provide hands-only CPR. Push hard and fast on the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute until paramedics arrive. You don't need to do rescue breathing. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available nearby, have someone get the device for you, and then follow the instructions.

Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. These can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected An abnormal feeling or disappearing fontanel on your baby's skull Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures Slow or no growth of the head as your baby grows Types of craniosynostosis There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Most cases of multiple suture craniosynostosis are linked to genetic syndromes and are called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. Sagittal craniosynostosis results in a head shape called scaphocephaly and is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of your baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side. Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time on one side of his or her head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more normal appearance. When to see a doctor Your doctor will routinely monitor your child's head growth at well-child visits. Talk to your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby's head growth or shape.

"}, {"illness": "Schizophrenia", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443", "symptoms": "Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include: Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45. Symptoms in teenagers Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen years, such as: Withdrawal from friends and family A drop in performance at school Trouble sleeping Irritability or depressed mood Lack of motivation Also, recreational substance use, such as marijuana, methamphetamines or LSD, can sometimes cause similar signs and symptoms. Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, teens may be: Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations When to see a doctor People with schizophrenia often lack awareness that their difficulties stem from a mental disorder that requires medical attention. So it often falls to family or friends to get them help. Helping someone who may have schizophrenia If you think someone you know may have symptoms of schizophrenia, talk to him or her about your concerns. Although you can't force someone to seek professional help, you can offer encouragement and support and help your loved one find a qualified doctor or mental health professional. If your loved one poses a danger to self or others or can't provide his or her own food, clothing, or shelter, you may need to call 911 or other emergency responders for help so that your loved one can be evaluated by a mental health professional. In some cases, emergency hospitalization may be needed. Laws on involuntary commitment for mental health treatment vary by state. You can contact community mental health agencies or police departments in your area for details. Suicidal thoughts and behavior Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with schizophrenia. If you have a loved one who is in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.

At this stage, you may experience signs and symptoms similar to asthma or pneumonia, including: Persistent cough Shortness of breath Wheezing After spending 10 to 14 days in the lungs, the larvae travel to the throat, where you cough them up and then swallow them. In the intestines The larvae mature into adult worms in the small intestine, and the adult worms typically live in the intestines until they die. In mild or moderate ascariasis, the intestinal infestation can cause: Vague abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea or bloody stools If you have a large number of worms in the intestine, you might have: Severe abdominal pain Fatigue Vomiting Weight loss or malnutrition A worm in your vomit or stool When to see a doctor Talk to your doctor if you have persistent abdominal pain, diarrhea or nausea.

The disease can be present with the appearance of a single chancre (shown here on a penis) or many. Syphilis develops in stages, and symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap, and symptoms don't always occur in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis without noticing any symptoms for years. Primary syphilis The first sign of syphilis is a small sore, called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. While most people infected with syphilis develop only one chancre, some people develop several of them. The chancre usually develops about three weeks after exposure. Many people who have syphilis don't notice the chancre because it's usually painless, and it may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre will heal on its own within three to six weeks. Secondary syphilis Within a few weeks of the original chancre healing, you may experience a rash that begins on your trunk but eventually covers your entire body \u2014 even the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. This rash is usually not itchy and may be accompanied by wartlike sores in your mouth or genital area. Some people also experience hair loss, muscle aches, a fever, a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms may disappear within a few weeks or repeatedly come and go for as long as a year. Latent syphilis If you aren't treated for syphilis, the disease moves from the secondary stage to the hidden (latent) stage, when you have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years. Signs and symptoms may never return, or the disease may progress to the third (tertiary) stage. Tertiary syphilis About 15% to 30% of people infected with syphilis who don't get treatment will develop complications known as tertiary syphilis. In the late stage, the disease may damage the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints. These problems may occur many years after the original, untreated infection. Neurosyphilis At any stage, syphilis can spread and, among other damage, cause damage to the brain and nervous system and the eye. Congenital syphilis Babies born to women who have syphilis can become infected through the placenta or during birth. Most newborns with congenital syphilis have no symptoms, although some experience a rash on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. Later signs and symptoms may include deafness, teeth deformities and saddle nose \u2014 where the bridge of the nose collapses.

Dr. Stacey Rizza, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic, says syphilis affects men and women and can present in various stages. Stacey Rizza, M.D.: Primary syphilis causes an ulcer, and this sometimes isn't noticed because it's painless and can be inside the vagina or on the cervix\u2026after a few weeks, two months, they can get secondary syphilis, which is a rash. Vivien Williams: It may then progress to latent stage syphilis and, finally, the most serious stage: tertiary. Pregnant women are not immune to syphilis. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or infant deaths. That's why all pregnant women should be screened. Syphilis is preventable and treatable. As for prevention, Dr. Rizza recommends barrier protection during sex. Dr. Rizza: And that's during oral sex, anal sex, vaginal sex \u2014 using condoms, dental dams and any other barrier protection.

The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. Leaking bumps or sores. Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor. Tunnels. Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal very slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus. Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable. Excess weight and being a smoker are associated with worse symptoms, but even people who are thin and don't smoke can experience severe disease.

Time is critical when you're helping an unconscious person who isn't breathing. If you see someone who's unconscious and not breathing normally, do the following: Call 911 or emergency medical help. If you have immediate access to a telephone, call before beginning CPR. Perform CPR. Quickly check the person's breathing. If the person isn't breathing normally, begin CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest \u2014 at the rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute. If you've been trained in CPR, check the person's airway and deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions. If you haven't been trained, just continue chest compressions. Allow the chest to rise completely between compressions. Keep doing this until a portable defibrillator is available or emergency workers arrive. Use a portable defibrillator, if one is available. It will give you step-by-step voice instructions. Continue chest compressions while the defibrillator is charging. When it's charged, the defibrillator will check the person's heart rhythm and recommend a shock if needed. Deliver one shock if advised by the device and then immediately resume CPR, starting with chest compressions, or give chest compressions only, for about two minutes. Using the defibrillator, check the person's heart rhythm. If necessary, the defibrillator will give another shock. Repeat this cycle until the person recovers consciousness or emergency workers take over. Portable automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are available in many places, including airports, casinos and shopping malls. You can also purchase one for your home. AEDs come with built-in instructions for their use. They're programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate.

New or different symptoms may signal a more dangerous form of angina (unstable angina) or a heart attack. Characteristics of unstable angina (a medical emergency) Occurs even at rest Is a change in your usual pattern of angina Is unexpected Is usually more severe and lasts longer than stable angina, maybe 30 minutes or longer May not disappear with rest or use of angina medication Might signal a heart attack There's another type of angina, called variant angina or Prinzmetal's angina. This type of angina is rarer. It's caused by a spasm in your heart's arteries that temporarily reduces blood flow. Characteristics of variant angina (Prinzmetal's angina) Usually happens when you're resting Is often severe May be relieved by angina medication Angina in women Symptoms of angina in women can be different from angina symptoms that occur in men. These differences may lead to delays in seeking treatment. For example, chest pain is a common symptom in women with angina, but it may not be the only symptom or the most prevalent symptom for women. Women may also have symptoms such as: Nausea Shortness of breath Abdominal pain Discomfort in the neck, jaw or back Stabbing pain instead of chest pressure When to see a doctor If your chest pain lasts longer than a few minutes and doesn't go away when you rest or take your angina medications, it may be a sign you're having a heart attack.

The lowest part of your spinal cord that remains undamaged after an injury is referred to as the neurological level of your injury. The severity of the injury is often called \"the completeness\" and is classified as either of the following: Complete. If all feeling (sensory) and all ability to control movement (motor function) are lost below the spinal cord injury, your injury is called complete. Incomplete. If you have some motor or sensory function below the affected area, your injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury.

Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion A staring spell Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs Loss of consciousness or awareness Cognitive or emotional symptoms, such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where abnormal brain activity begins. Seizures may also be classified as unknown onset, if how the seizure began isn't known. Focal seizures Focal seizures result from abnormal electrical activity in one area of your brain. Focal seizures can occur with or without loss of consciousness: Focal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness that feels like being in a dream. You may seem awake, but you stare into space and do not respond normally to your environment or you perform repetitive movements. These may include hand rubbing, mouth movements, repeating certain words or walking in circles. You may not remember the seizure or even know that it occurred. Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. These seizures may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound, but you don't lose consciousness. You may suddenly feel angry, joyful or sad. Some people have nausea or unusual feelings that are difficult to describe. These seizures may also result in difficulty speaking, involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or a leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Different types of generalized seizures include: Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or by subtle body movements, such as eye blinking or lip smacking. They usually last for five to 10 seconds but may happen up to hundreds of times per day. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to lose consciousness and fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse, fall down or drop your head. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. There is often no loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. They may last for several minutes. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You're experiencing heat exhaustion. You're pregnant. You have diabetes. You've injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice.

"}, {"illness": "Bipolar disorder", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bipolar-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355955", "symptoms": "There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years \u2014 or one year in children and teenagers \u2014 of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired Increased activity, energy or agitation Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) Decreased need for sleep Unusual talkativeness Racing thoughts Distractibility Poor decision-making \u2014 for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all \u2014 or almost all \u2014 activities Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) Either insomnia or sleeping too much Either restlessness or slowed behavior Fatigue or loss of energy Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out \u2014 and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number \u2014 in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.

Classic PKU. The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU. The enzyme needed to convert phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced, resulting in high levels of phenylalanine and severe brain damage. Less severe forms of PKU. In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme retains some function, so phenylalanine levels are not as high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage. But most children with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications.

For example, cluster periods can occur seasonally, such as every spring or every fall. Most people have episodic cluster headaches. In episodic cluster headaches, the headaches occur for one week to a year, followed by a pain-free remission period that can last as long as 12 months before another cluster headache develops.

He or she can determine the degree of your farsightedness and advise you of options to correct your vision. Since it may not always be readily apparent that you're having trouble with your vision, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends the following intervals for regular eye exams: Adults If you're at high risk of certain eye diseases, such as glaucoma, get a dilated eye exam every one to two years, starting at age 40. If you don't wear glasses or contacts, have no symptoms of eye trouble, and are at a low risk of developing eye diseases, such as glaucoma, get an eye exam at the following intervals: An initial exam at 40 Every two to four years between ages 40 and 54 Every one to three years between ages 55 and 64 Every one to two years beginning at age 65 If you wear glasses or contacts or you have a health condition that affects the eyes, such as diabetes, you'll likely need to have your eyes checked regularly. Ask your eye doctor how frequently you need to schedule your appointments. But, if you notice problems with your vision, schedule an appointment with your eye doctor as soon as possible, even if you've recently had an eye exam. Blurred vision, for example, may suggest you need a prescription change, or it could be a sign of another problem. Children and adolescents Children need to be screened for eye disease and have their vision tested by a pediatrician, an ophthalmologist, an optometrist or another trained screener at the following ages and intervals.

Your baby is most at risk of contracting toxoplasmosis if you become infected in the third trimester and least at risk if you become infected during the first trimester. On the other hand, the earlier in your pregnancy the infection occurs, the more serious the outcome for your baby. Many early infections end in stillbirth or miscarriage. Infants who survive are likely to be born with serious problems, such as: Seizures An enlarged liver and spleen Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Severe eye infections Only a small number of babies who have toxoplasmosis show signs of the disease at birth. Often, infants who are infected don't develop signs \u2014 which may include hearing loss, mental disability or serious eye infections \u2014 until their teens or later.

Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person, depending on which pituitary hormones are affected and to what degree. In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency, the second deficiency may increase or, in some cases, hide the symptoms of the first deficiency. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children, GH deficiency may cause growth problems and short stature. Most adults who have GH deficiency don't have any symptoms, but for some adults it can cause: Fatigue Muscle weakness Changes in body fat composition Lack of ambition Social isolation Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency Deficiency of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affect the reproductive system. In women, the deficiency decreases egg and estrogen production from the ovaries. In men, the deficiency decreases sperm and testosterone production from the testicles. Women and men may experience a lower sex drive, infertility or fatigue. In children and adolescents, delayed puberty is usually the only symptom. Women may also have symptoms such as: Hot flashes Irregular or no periods Loss of pubic hair An inability to produce milk for breast-feeding Men may also have symptoms such as: Erectile dysfunction Decreased facial or body hair Mood changes Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency This hormone controls the thyroid gland. A TSH deficiency leads to low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). This causes symptoms such as: Fatigue Weight gain Dry skin Constipation Sensitivity to cold or difficulty staying warm Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency This hormone helps your adrenal glands work properly, and helps your body react to stress. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include: Severe fatigue Low blood pressure, which may lead to fainting Frequent and prolonged infections Nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain Confusion Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency This hormone, which is also called vasopressin, helps your body balance its fluid levels. An ADH deficiency can cause a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause: Excessive urination Extreme thirst Electrolyte imbalances Prolactin deficiency Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk. Low levels of prolactin can cause women to have problems making milk for breast-feeding.

The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp and buttocks. This condition is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the skin condition might not cause digestive symptoms. Doctors treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medication, or both, to control the rash. When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if you have diarrhea or digestive discomfort that lasts for more than two weeks. Consult your child's doctor if your child is pale, irritable or failing to grow or has a potbelly and foul-smelling, bulky stools. Be sure to consult your doctor before trying a gluten-free diet. If you stop or even reduce the amount of gluten you eat before you're tested for celiac disease, you can change the test results. Celiac disease tends to run in families. If someone in your family has the condition, ask your doctor if you should be tested. Also ask your doctor about testing if you or someone in your family has a risk factor for celiac disease, such as type 1 diabetes.

But because they shed cholera bacteria in their stool for seven to 14 days, they can still infect others through contaminated water. Most cases of cholera that cause symptoms cause mild or moderate diarrhea that's often hard to tell apart from diarrhea caused by other problems. Others develop more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection. Symptoms of cholera infection can include: Diarrhea. Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss \u2014 as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed. Nausea and vomiting. Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours. Dehydration. Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. A loss of 10% or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration. Signs and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability, fatigue, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry and shriveled skin that's slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold, little or no urinating, low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat. Dehydration can lead to a rapid loss of minerals in your blood that maintain the balance of fluids in your body. This is called an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolyte imbalance An electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious signs and symptoms such as: Muscle cramps. These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium, chloride and potassium. Shock. This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body. If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in minutes. When to see a doctor The risk of cholera is slight in industrialized nations. Even in areas where it exists you're not likely to become infected if you follow food safety recommendations. Still, cases of cholera occur throughout the world. If you develop severe diarrhea after visiting an area with active cholera, see your doctor.

The two main types of priapism are ischemic priapism and nonischemic priapism. Ischemic priapism Ischemic priapism, also called low-flow priapism, is the result of blood not being able to leave the penis. Blood is trapped in the penis because it cannot flow out of the veins of the penis or there is a problem with the contraction of smooth muscles within the erectile tissue of the penis. Ischemic priapism is the more common type of priapism and requires immediate medical care to prevent complications caused by not getting enough oxygen to the penile tissue. Signs and symptoms include: Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Rigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis (glans) is soft Progressively worsening penile pain Stuttering priapism \u2014 also called recurrent or intermittent priapism \u2014 is a form of ischemic priapism. An uncommon condition, stuttering priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism. It occurs more often in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell disease). Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more-frequent and more-prolonged erections. Stuttering priapism may begin in childhood. Nonischemic priapism Nonischemic priapism, also known as high-flow priapism, occurs when blood flow through the arteries of the penis isn't working properly. However, the penile tissues continue to receive some blood flow and oxygen. Nonischemic priapism often occurs due to trauma. Signs and symptoms include: Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Erect but not fully rigid penile shaft Usually not painful When to see a doctor If you have an erection lasting more than four hours, you need emergency care. The emergency room doctor will determine whether you have ischemic priapism or nonischemic priapism.

They vary from person to person and change over time. Signs and symptoms can include: Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving you with too few red blood cells. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen, causing fatigue. Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. Pain can also occur in your bones. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few weeks. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more pain crises a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes. Swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood flow to the hands and feet. Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage your spleen, leaving you more vulnerable to infections. Doctors commonly give infants and children with sickle cell anemia vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. Delayed growth or puberty. Red blood cells provide your body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes can become plugged with sickle cells.

Schizotypal personality disorder vs. schizophrenia Schizotypal personality disorder can easily be confused with schizophrenia, a severe mental illness in which people lose contact with reality (psychosis). While people with schizotypal personality disorder may experience brief psychotic episodes with delusions or hallucinations, the episodes are not as frequent, prolonged or intense as in schizophrenia. Another key distinction is that people with schizotypal personality disorder usually can be made aware of the difference between their distorted ideas and reality. Those with schizophrenia generally can't be swayed away from their delusions. Despite the differences, people with schizotypal personality disorder can benefit from treatments similar to those used for schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder is sometimes considered to be on a spectrum with schizophrenia, with schizotypal personality disorder viewed as less severe. When to see a doctor People with schizotypal personality disorder are likely to seek help only at the urging of friends or family members. Or people with schizotypal personality disorder may seek help for another problem such as depression. If you suspect that a friend or family member may have the disorder, you might gently suggest that the person seek medical attention, starting with a primary care doctor or mental health professional. If you need immediate help If you're concerned that you might harm yourself or someone else, go to an emergency room or call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.

Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will necessarily be more severe. Mild reaction Most of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include: Instant, sharp burning pain at the sting site A red welt at the sting area Slight swelling around the sting area In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours. Moderate reaction Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a bit stronger reaction, with signs and symptoms such as: Extreme redness Swelling at the site of the sting that gradually enlarges over the next day or two Moderate reactions tend to resolve over five to 10 days. Having a moderate reaction doesn't mean you'll have a severe allergic reaction the next time you're stung. But some people develop similar moderate reactions each time they're stung. If this happens to you, talk to your doctor about treatment and prevention, especially if the reaction becomes more severe each time. Severe allergic reaction A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to bee stings is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect quickly develop anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin Difficulty breathing Swelling of the throat and tongue A weak, rapid pulse Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness or fainting Loss of consciousness People who have a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting have a 25% to 65% chance of anaphylaxis the next time they're stung. Talk to your doctor or an allergy specialist about prevention measures such as immunotherapy (\"allergy shots\") to avoid a similar reaction in case you get stung again. Multiple bee stings Generally, insects such as bees and wasps aren't aggressive and only sting in self-defense. In most cases, this results in one or perhaps a few stings. In some cases a person will disrupt a hive or swarm of bees and get multiple stings. Some types of bees \u2014 such as Africanized honeybees \u2014 are more likely than are other bees to swarm, stinging in a group. If you get stung more than a dozen times, the accumulation of venom may induce a toxic reaction and make you feel quite sick. Signs and symptoms include: Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Headache A feeling of spinning (vertigo) Convulsions Fever Dizziness or fainting Multiple stings can be a medical emergency in children, older adults, and people who have heart or breathing problems. When to see a doctor In most cases, bee stings don't require a visit to your doctor. In more-severe cases, you'll need immediate care. Call 911 or other emergency services if you're having a serious reaction to a bee sting that suggests anaphylaxis, even if it's just one or two signs or symptoms. If you were prescribed an emergency epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others), use it right away as your doctor directed.

Laughter often turns to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing. The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded. Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect. When to see a doctor If you think you have PBA, talk to your doctor. If you have a neurological condition, you might already be treated by a doctor who can diagnose PBA. Helpful specialists include neuropsychologists, neurologists and psychiatrists. It's suspected that many cases of pseudobulbar affect go unreported and undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness about the condition.

Sometimes they are identified incidentally on an imaging test such as an MRI or CT performed for some other reason. Pituitary tumors that make hormones (functioning) can cause a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the hormone they produce. The signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors that don't make hormones (nonfunctioning) are related to their growth and the pressure they put on other structures. Large pituitary tumors \u2014 those measuring about 1 centimeter (slightly less than a half-inch) or larger \u2014 are known as macroadenomas. Smaller tumors are called microadenomas. Because of the size of macroadenomas, they can put pressure on the normal pituitary gland and nearby structures. Signs and symptoms related to tumor pressure Signs and symptoms of pressure from a pituitary tumor may include: Headache Vision loss, particularly loss of peripheral vision Symptoms related to hormone level changes Deficiency Large tumors could cause hormonal deficiencies. Signs and symptoms include: Nausea and vomiting Weakness Feeling cold Less frequent or no menstrual periods Sexual dysfunction Increased amount of urine Unintended weight loss or gain Overfunctioning Functioning pituitary tumors cause an overproduction of hormones. Different types of functioning tumors in your pituitary gland cause specific signs and symptoms and sometimes a combination of them. Adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting (ACTH) tumors ACTH tumors produce the hormone adrenocorticotropin, which stimulates your adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. Cushing syndrome results from your adrenal glands producing too much cortisol. Possible signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome include: Fat accumulation around your midsection and upper back Exaggerated facial roundness Thinning of the arms and legs with muscle weakness High blood pressure High blood sugar Acne Bone weakening Bruising Stretch marks Anxiety, irritability or depression Growth hormone-secreting tumors These tumors produce excess growth hormone (acromegaly), which can cause: Coarsened facial features Enlarged hands and feet Excess sweating High blood sugar Heart problems Joint pain Misaligned teeth Increased body hair Children and adolescents might grow too fast or too tall. Prolactin-secreting tumors Overproduction of prolactin from a pituitary tumor (prolactinoma) can cause a decrease in normal levels of sex hormones \u2014 estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Excessive prolactin in the blood affects men and women differently. In women, prolactinoma might cause: Irregular menstrual periods Lack of menstrual periods Milky discharge from the breasts In men, a prolactin-producing tumor may cause male hypogonadism. Signs and symptoms can include: Erectile dysfunction Lowered sperm count Loss of sex drive Breast growth Thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors When a pituitary tumor overproduces thyroid-stimulating hormone, your thyroid gland makes too much of the hormone thyroxine. This is a rare cause of hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your body's metabolism, causing: Weight loss Rapid or irregular heartbeat Nervousness or irritability Frequent bowel movements Excessive sweating When to see a doctor If you develop signs and symptoms that might be associated with a pituitary tumor, see your doctor. Pituitary tumors often can be treated to return your hormone levels to normal and alleviate your signs and symptoms. If you know that multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) runs in your family, talk to your doctor about periodic tests that may help detect a pituitary tumor early.

Although the signs and symptoms are unique for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include: Skin abnormalities. Most people with tuberous sclerosis have patches of light-colored skin, or they may develop small, harmless areas of thickened, smooth skin or reddish bumps under or around the nails. Facial growths that begin in childhood and resemble acne also are common. Seizures. Growths in the brain may be associated with seizures, which can be the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm shows up as repetitive spasms of the head and legs. Cognitive disabilities. Tuberous sclerosis can be associated with developmental delays and sometimes intellectual disability or learning disabilities. Mental health disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also can occur. Behavioral problems. Common behavioral problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment. Kidney problems. Most people with tuberous sclerosis develop noncancerous growths on their kidneys, and they may develop more growths as they age. Heart issues. Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as the child gets older. Lung problems. Growths that develop in the lungs may cause coughing or shortness of breath, especially with physical activity or exercise. These benign lung tumors occur more often in women than in men. Eye abnormalities. Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). These noncancerous growths don't always interfere with vision.

Early signs include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations. As the disease progresses, memory impairments worsen and other symptoms develop. At first, a person with Alzheimer's disease may be aware of having difficulty remembering things and organizing thoughts. A family member or friend may be more likely to notice how the symptoms worsen. Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease lead to growing trouble with: Memory Everyone has occasional memory lapses, but the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease persists and worsens, affecting the ability to function at work or at home. People with Alzheimer's may: Repeat statements and questions over and over Forget conversations, appointments or events, and not remember them later Routinely misplace possessions, often putting them in illogical locations Get lost in familiar places Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects Have trouble finding the right words to identify objects, express thoughts or take part in conversations Thinking and reasoning Alzheimer's disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Multitasking is especially difficult, and it may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually, a person with Alzheimer's may be unable to recognize and deal with numbers. Making judgments and decisions Alzheimer's causes a decline in the ability to make reasonable decisions and judgments in everyday situations. For example, a person may make poor or uncharacteristic choices in social interactions or wear clothes that are inappropriate for the weather. It may be more difficult to respond effectively to everyday problems, such as food burning on the stove or unexpected driving situations. Planning and performing familiar tasks Once-routine activities that require sequential steps, such as planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game, become a struggle as the disease progresses. Eventually, people with advanced Alzheimer's often forget how to perform basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Changes in personality and behavior Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Problems may include the following: Depression Apathy Social withdrawal Mood swings Distrust in others Irritability and aggressiveness Changes in sleeping habits Wandering Loss of inhibitions Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen Preserved skills Many important skills are preserved for longer periods even while symptoms worsen. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories and reminiscing, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts. These skills may be preserved longer because they are controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease. When to see a doctor A number of conditions, including treatable conditions, can result in memory loss or other dementia symptoms. If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your doctor for a thorough assessment and diagnosis. If you are concerned about thinking skills you observe in a family member or friend, talk about your concerns and ask about going together to a doctor's appointment.

Skin-related signs and symptoms Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of the skin. The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness. Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays. Raynaud's phenomenon Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma. Digestive problems Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include: Heartburn Difficulty swallowing Bloating Diarrhea Constipation Fecal incontinence Heart and lung problems When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage. Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart. When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.

Forms of deep folliculitis include: Sycosis barbae. This type affects males who have begun to shave. Gram-negative folliculitis. This type sometimes develops if you're receiving long-term antibiotic therapy for acne. Boils (furuncles) and carbuncles. These occur when hair follicles become deeply infected with staph bacteria. A boil usually appears suddenly as a painful pink or red bump. A carbuncle is a cluster of boils. Eosinophilic (e-o-sin-o-FILL-ik) folliculitis. This type mainly affects people with HIV/AIDS. Signs and symptoms include intense itching and recurring patches of bumps and pimples that form near hair follicles of the face and upper body.

Neurofibromatosis 1 Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is usually diagnosed during childhood. Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms include: Flat, light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spots are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing. Freckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling usually appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. Bone deformities. Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg. Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumors usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults. Learning disabilities. Impaired thinking skills are common in children who have NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height. Neurofibromatosis 2 Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Also known as vestibular schwannomas, these tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Signs and symptoms generally appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms can include: Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ears Poor balance Headaches Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. People who have NF2 may also develop other benign tumors. Signs and symptoms of these tumors can include: Numbness and weakness in the arms or legs Pain Balance difficulties Facial drop Vision problems or cataracts Seizures Headache Schwannomatosis This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between ages 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis causes tumors to develop on the cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves \u2014 but rarely on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, so people who have schwannomatosis don't experience the same hearing loss as people who have NF2. Symptoms of schwannomatosis include: Chronic pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling Numbness or weakness in various parts of the body Loss of muscle When to see a doctor See your doctor if you or your child develop signs or symptoms of neurofibromatosis. The tumors associated with neurofibromatosis are often benign and slow growing.

Migraines and headaches from sinusitis are easy to confuse because the signs and symptoms of the two types of headaches may overlap. Both migraine and sinusitis headache pain often gets worse when you bend forward. Migraine can also be accompanied by various nasal signs and symptoms \u2014 including congestion, facial pressure and a clear, watery nasal discharge. These are due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in a migraine attack. In fact, studies have shown that approximately 90% of people who see a doctor for sinus headaches are found to have migraines instead. Sinusitis, however, usually isn't associated with nausea or vomiting or aggravated by noise or bright light \u2014 all common features of migraines. Sinusitis usually occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection or cold and includes thick, discolored nasal mucus, decreased sense of smell, and pain in one cheek or upper teeth.

Classic CAH Female infants who have classic CAH may have a condition known as ambiguous genitalia, in which the clitoris is enlarged or the genitals look more like those of a male child. Male infants who have classic CAH have normal appearing genitals. Both male and female infants can be seriously affected by a lack of cortisol, aldosterone or both. This is known as an adrenal crisis, and it can be life-threatening. The salt-losing form and simple-virilizing form of classic CAH cause children's bodies to produce an insufficient amount of cortisol. These children can have problems maintaining normal blood pressure, normal blood sugar and energy levels, and are more vulnerable to stress. An excess of the male sex hormones can result in short height and early puberty for both boys and girls. Signs and symptoms of classic CAH in children and adults include: Appearance of pubic hair at a very early age Rapid growth during childhood, but shorter than average final height Nonclassic CAH Often there are no symptoms of nonclassic CAH when a baby is born. The condition is not identified on routine infant blood screening and usually becomes evident in late childhood or early adulthood. Cortisol may be the only hormone that's deficient. Teenage and adult females who have nonclassic CAH may have normal appearing genitals at birth, but later in life, they may experience: Irregular or absent menstrual periods Masculine characteristics such as facial hair, excessive body hair and a deepening voice Severe acne In both females and males, signs of nonclassic CAH may also include: Early appearance of pubic hair Rapid growth during childhood, an advanced bone age and shorter predicted final height When to see a doctor Classic CAH is usually detected at birth through required newborn screening or when female babies have ambiguous genitalia. CAH may also be identified when male or female babies show signs of severe illness due to low levels of cortisol, aldosterone or both. In children who have nonclassic CAH, signs and symptoms of early puberty may appear. If you have concerns about your child's growth or development, make an appointment with your child's doctor.

Characteristics may be related to the specific gene containing the mutation. Facial features Facial appearance is one of the key clinical features that leads to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. These features may be more pronounced in infants and young children, but change with age. In adulthood, these distinct features become more subtle. Features may include the following: Eyes are wide-set and down-slanting with droopy lids. Irises are pale blue or green. Ears are low-set and rotated backward. Nose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and bulbous tip. Mouth has a deep groove between the nose and the mouth and wide peaks in the upper lip. The crease that runs from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth becomes deeply grooved with age. Teeth may be crooked, the inside roof of the mouth (palate) may be highly arched and the lower jaw may be small. Facial features may appear coarse, but appear sharper with age. The face may appear droopy and expressionless. Head may appear large with a prominent forehead and a low hairline on the back of the head. Skin may appear thin and transparent with age. Heart disease Many people with Noonan syndrome are born with some form of heart defect (congenital heart disease), accounting for some of the key signs and symptoms of the disorder. Some heart problems can occur later in life. Some forms of congenital heart disease associated with this disorder include: Valve disorders. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, the flap of tissue that separates the lower right chamber (ventricle) of the heart from the artery that supplies blood to the lungs (pulmonary artery). It's the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome, and it may occur alone or with other heart defects. Thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This is abnormal growth or thickening of the heart muscle that affects some people with Noonan syndrome. Other structural defects of the heart. The defects can involve a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect), narrowing of the artery that carries blood to the lungs for oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis), or narrowing of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carries blood from the heart to the body (aortic coarctation). Irregular heart rhythm. This can occur with or without structural heart abnormalities. Irregular heart rhythm occurs in the majority of people with Noonan syndrome. Growth issues Noonan syndrome can affect normal growth. Many children with Noonan syndrome don't grow at a normal rate. Issues may include the following: Birth weight will likely be normal, but growth slows over time. Eating difficulties may result in inadequate nutrition and poor weight gain. Growth hormone levels may be insufficient. The growth spurt that's usually seen during the teenage years may be delayed. But because this disorder causes bone maturity to be delayed, growth sometimes continues into the late teens. By adulthood, some people with Noonan syndrome may have normal height, but short stature is more common. Musculoskeletal issues Some common issues can include: An unusually shaped chest often with a sunken sternum (pectus excavatum) or raised sternum (pectus carinatum) Wide-set nipples Short neck, often with extra folds of skin (webbed neck) or prominent neck muscles (trapezius) Deformities of the spine Learning disabilities Intelligence isn't affected for most people with Noonan syndrome. However, individuals may have: An increased risk of learning disabilities and mild intellectual disability A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issues that are usually mild Hearing and vision deficits that may complicate learning Eye conditions A common sign of Noonan syndrome is abnormalities of the eyes and eyelids. These may include: Problems with the eye muscles, such as cross-eye (strabismus) Refractive problems, such as astigmatism, nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) Rapid movement of the eyeballs (nystagmus) Cataracts Hearing problems Noonan syndrome can cause hearing deficits due to nerve issues or to structural abnormalities in the inner ear bones. Bleeding Noonan syndrome can cause excessive bleeding and bruising due to clotting defects or having too few platelets. Lymphatic conditions Noonan syndrome can cause problems with the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from the body and helps fight infection. These problems: May show up before or after birth or develop in the teenage years or adulthood Can be focused in a particular area of the body or widespread Most commonly cause excess fluid (lymphedema) on the back of the hands or top of the feet Genital and kidney conditions Many people, especially males, with Noonan syndrome can have problems with the genitals and kidneys. Testicles. Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) are common in males. Puberty. Puberty may be delayed in both boys and girls. Fertility. Most females develop normal fertility. In males, however, fertility may not develop normally, often because of undescended testicles. Kidneys. Kidney problems are generally mild and occur in a fairly small number of people with Noonan syndrome. Skin conditions People with Noonan syndrome may have skin conditions, which most commonly are: Various problems that affect the color and texture of the skin Curly, coarse hair or sparse hair When to see a doctor The signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome can be subtle. If you suspect you or your child may have the disorder, see your primary care doctor or your child's pediatrician. You or your child may be referred to a geneticist or a cardiologist. If your unborn child is at risk because of a family history of Noonan syndrome, prenatal tests may be available.

Skin The most recognizable form of albinism results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings. Skin coloring (pigmentation) and hair color can range from white to brown, and may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism. With exposure to the sun, some people may develop: Freckles Moles, with or without pigment \u2014 moles without pigment are generally pink-colored Large freckle-like spots (lentigines) Sunburn and the inability to tan For some people with albinism, skin pigmentation never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in pigmentation. Hair Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, reddish or brown. Hair color may also darken by early adulthood or stain from exposure to normal minerals in water and the environment, and appear darker with age. Eye color Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age. The lack of pigment in the colored part of the eyes (irises) makes the irises somewhat translucent. This means that the irises can't completely block light from entering the eye. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting. Vision Vision impairment is a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems and issues may include: Rapid, involuntary back-and-forth movement of the eyes (nystagmus) Head movements, such as bobbing or tilting the head, to try to reduce the involuntary eye movements and see better Inability of both eyes to stay directed at the same point or to move in unison (strabismus) Extreme nearsightedness or farsightedness Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Abnormal curvature of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye (astigmatism), which causes blurred vision Abnormal development of the retina, resulting in reduced vision Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways (misrouting of the optic nerve) Poor depth perception Legal blindness (vision less than 20/200) or complete blindness When to see a doctor At your child's birth, if the doctor notices a lack of pigment in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows, the doctor will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's pigmentation and vision. If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your doctor. Contact your doctor if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or chronic infections. These signs and symptoms may indicate the presence of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome or Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which are rare but serious disorders that include albinism.

This defect causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body. The bladder is also turned inside out. Usually, bladder exstrophy will involve organs of the urinary tract, as well as the digestive and reproductive systems. Defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitals, pelvic bones, final section of the large intestine (rectum) and opening at the end of the rectum (anus) can occur. Children with bladder exstrophy also have vesicoureteral reflux. This condition causes urine to flow the wrong way \u2014 from the bladder back up into the tubes that connect to the kidneys (ureters). Children with bladder exstrophy also have epispadias. Cloacal exstrophy. Cloacal exstrophy (kloe-A-kul EK-stroh-fee) is the most serious form of BEEC. In this condition, the rectum, bladder and genitals don't fully separate as the fetus develops. These organs may not be correctly formed, and the pelvic bones are affected as well. The kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected. Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal abnormalities, including spina bifida. Children born with protruding abdominal organs probably also have cloacal exstrophy or bladder exstrophy.

Brain aneurysms develop as a result of thinning artery walls. Aneurysms often form at forks or branches in arteries because those sections of the vessel are weaker. Although aneurysms can appear anywhere in the brain, they are most common in arteries at the base of the brain. Mayo Clinic Minute: What is an aneurysm? Show transcript An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. \"A proportion of these patients will go on to have a rupture. And the challenge with rupture is that it's unpredictable.\" Dr. Bernard Bendok says a ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency that can cause life-threatening bleeding in the brain. \"The typical presentation is somebody who has the worst headache of their life.\" Fast treatment is essential. It includes open surgery, or less-invasive options, such as sealing the ruptured artery from within the blood vessel with metal coils and/or stents. Dr. Bendok says 1 to 2 percent of the population have aneurysms, and only a small percentage of that group will experience a rupture. People who have a family history of aneurysms, have polycystic kidney disease, connective tissue disease, and people who smoke are at increased risk of rupture, and should consider screening. If a rupture happens, fast treatment can save lives.

Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the last couple of months of normal fetal development, the testicles gradually descend from the abdomen through a tube-like passageway in the groin (inguinal canal) into the scrotum. With an undescended testicle, that process stops or is delayed. When to see a doctor An undescended testicle is typically detected when your baby is examined shortly after birth. If your son has an undescended testicle, ask the doctor how often your son will need to be examined. If the testicle hasn't moved into the scrotum by the time your son is 4 months old, the problem probably won't correct itself. Treating an undescended testicle when your son is still a baby might lower the risk of complications later in life, such as infertility and testicular cancer. Older boys \u2014 from infants to pre-adolescent boys \u2014 who have normally descended testicles at birth might appear to be \"missing\" a testicle later. This condition might indicate: A retractile testicle, which moves back and forth between the scrotum and the groin and might be easily guided by hand into the scrotum during a physical exam. This is not abnormal and is due to a muscle reflex in the scrotum. An ascending testicle, or acquired undescended testicle, that has \"returned\" to the groin and can't be easily guided by hand into the scrotum.

Type 1 is by far the most common. Siblings, even identical twins, with the disease can have different levels of severity. Some people who have Gaucher disease have only mild or no symptoms. Most people who have Gaucher disease have varying degrees of the following problems: Abdominal complaints. Because the liver and especially the spleen can enlarge dramatically, the abdomen can become painfully distended. Skeletal abnormalities. Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures. It can also interfere with the blood supply to your bones, which can cause portions of the bone to die. Blood disorders. A decrease in healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result in severe fatigue. Gaucher disease also affects the cells responsible for clotting, which can cause easy bruising and nosebleeds. More rarely, Gaucher disease affects the brain, which can cause abnormal eye movements, muscle rigidity, swallowing difficulties and seizures. One rare subtype of Gaucher disease begins in infancy and typically results in death by 2 years of age.

"}, {"illness": "Narcolepsy", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcolepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375497", "symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of narcolepsy may worsen for the first few years and then continue for life. They include: Excessive daytime sleepiness. People with narcolepsy fall asleep without warning, anywhere, anytime. For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly you nod off, sleeping for a few minutes up to a half-hour. When you awaken, you feel refreshed, but eventually you get sleepy again. You may also experience decreased alertness and focus throughout the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness usually is the first symptom to appear and is often the most troublesome, making it difficult for you to concentrate and fully function. Sudden loss of muscle tone. This condition, called cataplexy (KAT-uh-plek-see), can cause a number of physical changes, from slurred speech to complete weakness of most muscles, and may last up to a few minutes. Cataplexy is uncontrollable and is triggered by intense emotions, usually positive ones such as laughter or excitement, but sometimes fear, surprise or anger. For example, when you laugh, your head may droop uncontrollably or your knees may suddenly buckle. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year, while others have numerous episodes daily. Not everyone with narcolepsy experiences cataplexy. Sleep paralysis. People with narcolepsy often experience a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. These episodes are usually brief \u2014 lasting a few seconds or minutes \u2014 but can be frightening. You may be aware of the condition and have no difficulty recalling it afterward, even if you had no control over what was happening to you. This sleep paralysis mimics the type of temporary paralysis that normally occurs during a period of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This temporary immobility during REM sleep may prevent your body from acting out dream activity. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy, however. Many people without narcolepsy experience some episodes of sleep paralysis. Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is typically when most dreaming happens. REM sleep can occur at any time of the day in people with narcolepsy. People with narcolepsy often transition quickly to REM sleep, usually within 15 minutes of falling asleep. Hallucinations. These hallucinations are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep and hypnopompic hallucinations if they occur upon waking. An example is feeling as if there is a stranger in your bedroom. These hallucinations may be particularly vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming and you experience your dreams as reality. Other characteristics People with narcolepsy may have other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 a condition in which breathing starts and stops throughout the night \u2014 restless legs syndrome and even insomnia. Some people with narcolepsy experience automatic behavior during brief episodes of narcolepsy. For example, you may fall asleep while performing a task you normally perform, such as writing, typing or driving, and you continue to perform that task while asleep. When you awaken, you can't remember what you did, and you probably didn't do it well. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience excessive daytime sleepiness that disrupts your personal or professional life.

The rash gradually spreads over a period of days and can eventually reach up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually appear in stages, but the stages can overlap. Early signs and symptoms A small, red bump, similar to the bump of a mosquito bite, often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days. This normal occurrence doesn't indicate Lyme disease. However, these signs and symptoms can occur within a month after you've been infected: Rash. From three to 30 days after an infected tick bite, an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center, forming a bull's-eye pattern. The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. It's typically not itchy or painful but might feel warm to the touch. Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease, although not everyone with Lyme disease develops the rash. Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies. Other symptoms. Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, headache, neck stiffness and swollen lymph nodes can accompany the rash. Later signs and symptoms If untreated, new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months. These include: Erythema migrans. The rash may appear on other areas of your body. Joint pain. Bouts of severe joint pain and swelling are especially likely to affect your knees, but the pain can shift from one joint to another. Neurological problems. Weeks, months or even years after infection, you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis), temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy), numbness or weakness in your limbs, and impaired muscle movement. Less common signs and symptoms Several weeks after infection, some people develop: Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat Eye inflammation Liver inflammation (hepatitis) Severe fatigue When to see a doctor If you've been bitten by a tick and have symptoms Only a minority of tick bites leads to Lyme disease. The longer the tick remains attached to your skin, the greater your risk of getting the disease. Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours. If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease \u2014 particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is common \u2014 contact your doctor. Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early. See your doctor even if symptoms disappear Visit your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear \u2014 the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone. Untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body for several months to years after infection, causing arthritis and nervous system problems.

This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. Merkel cell carcinoma Merkel cell carcinoma Merkel cell carcinoma Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive skin cancer. It appears as a painless, flesh-colored or bluish-red nodule growing on your skin. Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women.

People with darker skin are more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that aren't often exposed to the sun. Squamous cell carcinoma may appear as: A firm, red nodule A flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface Melanoma signs and symptoms Melanoma can develop anywhere on your body, in otherwise normal skin or in an existing mole that becomes cancerous. Melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men. In women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs. In both men and women, melanoma can occur on skin that hasn't been exposed to the sun. Melanoma can affect people of any skin tone. In people with darker skin tones, melanoma tends to occur on the palms or soles, or under the fingernails or toenails. Melanoma signs include: A large brownish spot with darker speckles A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black A painful lesion that itches or burns Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus Signs and symptoms of less common skin cancers Other, less common types of skin cancer include: Kaposi sarcoma. This rare form of skin cancer develops in the skin's blood vessels and causes red or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes. Kaposi sarcoma mainly occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as people with AIDS, and in people taking medications that suppress their natural immunity, such as people who've undergone organ transplants. Other people with an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma include young men living in Africa or older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish heritage. Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma causes firm, shiny nodules that occur on or just beneath the skin and in hair follicles. Merkel cell carcinoma is most often found on the head, neck and trunk. Sebaceous gland carcinoma. This uncommon and aggressive cancer originates in the oil glands in the skin.

The retina lines the inside of the back of the eye, like wallpaper. The inside of the back of the eye is filled with a gel-like liquid called vitreous. The type of uveitis you have depends on which part or parts of the eye are inflamed: Anterior uveitis affects the inside of the front of your eye (between the cornea and the iris) and the ciliary body. It is also called iritis and is the most common type of uveitis. Intermediate uveitis affects the retina and blood vessels just behind the lens (pars plana) as well as the gel in the center of the eye (vitreous). Posterior uveitis affects a layer on the inside of the back of your eye, either the retina or the choroid.

Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. Other eating disorders include rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Anorexia nervosa Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa \u2014 often simply called anorexia \u2014 is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of weight or shape. People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape, which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities. When you have anorexia, you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight, such as excessive exercise, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce your weight, even when underweight, can cause severe health problems, sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation. Bulimia nervosa Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa \u2014 commonly called bulimia \u2014 is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. When you have bulimia, you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating. Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day, which often leads to more binge eating and purging. During these episodes, you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time, and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. Because of guilt, shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating, you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods, such as laxatives, to get rid of the calories. If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape, and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight. Binge-eating disorder When you have binge-eating disorder, you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating. You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended, even when you're not hungry, and you may continue eating even long after you're uncomfortably full. After a binge, you may feel guilty, disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten. But you don't try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging, as someone with bulimia or anorexia might. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing. A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week. You may be normal weight, overweight or obese. Rumination disorder Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating, but it's not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder. Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging, and regurgitation may not be intentional. Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out. The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly less to prevent the behavior. The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirements because you don't have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics, such as color, texture, smell or taste; or you're concerned about the consequences of eating, such as fear of choking. Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight. The disorder can result in significant weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood, as well as nutritional deficiencies that can cause health problems. When to see a doctor An eating disorder can be difficult to manage or overcome by yourself. Eating disorders can virtually take over your life. If you're experiencing any of these problems, or if you think you may have an eating disorder, seek medical help. Urging a loved one to seek treatment Unfortunately, many people with eating disorders may not think they need treatment. If you're worried about a loved one, urge him or her to talk to a doctor. Even if your loved one isn't ready to acknowledge having an issue with food, you can open the door by expressing concern and a desire to listen. Be alert for eating patterns and beliefs that may signal unhealthy behavior, as well as peer pressure that may trigger eating disorders. Red flags that may indicate an eating disorder include: Skipping meals or making excuses for not eating Adopting an overly restrictive vegetarian diet Excessive focus on healthy eating Making own meals rather than eating what the family eats Withdrawing from normal social activities Persistent worry or complaining about being fat and talk of losing weight Frequent checking in the mirror for perceived flaws Repeatedly eating large amounts of sweets or high-fat foods Use of dietary supplements, laxatives or herbal products for weight loss Excessive exercise Calluses on the knuckles from inducing vomiting Problems with loss of tooth enamel that may be a sign of repeated vomiting Leaving during meals to use the toilet Eating much more food in a meal or snack than is considered normal Expressing depression, disgust, shame or guilt about eating habits Eating in secret If you're worried that your child may have an eating disorder, contact his or her doctor to discuss your concerns. If needed, you can get a referral to a qualified mental health professional with expertise in eating disorders, or if your insurance permits it, contact an expert directly.

"}, {"illness": "Kleptomania", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kleptomania/symptoms-causes/syc-20364732", "symptoms": "Kleptomania symptoms may include: Inability to resist powerful urges to steal items that you don't need Feeling increased tension, anxiety or arousal leading up to the theft Feeling pleasure, relief or gratification while stealing Feeling terrible guilt, remorse, self-loathing, shame or fear of arrest after the theft Return of the urges and a repetition of the kleptomania cycle Features People with kleptomania typically exhibit these features or characteristics: Unlike typical shoplifters, people with kleptomania don't compulsively steal for personal gain, on a dare, for revenge or out of rebellion. They steal simply because the urge is so powerful that they can't resist it. Episodes of kleptomania generally occur spontaneously, usually without planning and without help or collaboration from another person. Most people with kleptomania steal from public places, such as stores and supermarkets. Some may steal from friends or acquaintances, such as at a party. Often, the stolen items have no value to the person with kleptomania, and the person can afford to buy them. The stolen items are usually stashed away, never to be used. Items may also be donated, given away to family or friends, or even secretly returned to the place from which they were stolen. Urges to steal may come and go or may occur with greater or lesser intensity over the course of time. When to see a doctor If you can't stop shoplifting or stealing, seek medical advice. Many people who may have kleptomania don't want to seek treatment because they're afraid they'll be arrested or jailed. However, a mental health professional typically doesn't report your thefts to authorities. Some people seek medical help because they're afraid they'll get caught and have legal consequences. Or they've already been arrested, and they're legally required to seek treatment. If a loved one has kleptomania If you suspect a close friend or family member may have kleptomania, gently raise your concerns with your loved one. Keep in mind that kleptomania is a mental health condition, not a character flaw, so approach your loved one without blame or accusation. It may be helpful to emphasize these points: You're concerned because you care about your loved one's health and well-being. You're worried about the risks of compulsive stealing, such as being arrested, losing a job or damaging a valued relationship. You understand that, with kleptomania, the urge to steal may be too strong to resist just by \"putting your mind to it.\" Treatments are available that may help to minimize the urge to steal and live without addiction and shame. If you need help preparing for this conversation, talk with your doctor. He or she may refer you to a mental health professional who can help you plan a way of raising your concerns without making your loved one feel defensive or threatened.

How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation. Signs and symptoms are also affected by the type of exposure \u2014 such as total or partial body. The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is. For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation. Initial signs and symptoms The initial signs and symptoms of treatable radiation sickness are usually nausea and vomiting. The amount of time between exposure and when these symptoms develop is a clue to how much radiation a person has absorbed. After the first round of signs and symptoms, a person with radiation sickness may have a brief period with no apparent illness, followed by the onset of new, more-serious symptoms. If you've had a mild exposure, it may take hours to weeks before any signs and symptoms begin. But with severe exposure, signs and symptoms can begin minutes to days after exposure. Possible symptoms include: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Headache Fever Dizziness and disorientation Weakness and fatigue Hair loss Bloody vomit and stools from internal bleeding Infections Low blood pressure When to see a doctor An accident or attack that causes radiation sickness would no doubt cause a lot of attention and public concern. If such an event occurs, monitor radio, television or online reports to learn about emergency instructions for your area.

About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months. Taking a temperature To take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers. Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements. In infants, doctors generally recommend taking a temperature with a rectal thermometer. When reporting a temperature to your or your child's doctor, give the reading and explain how the temperature was taken. When to see a doctor Fevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm \u2014 or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself. Infants An unexplained fever is greater cause for concern in infants and in children than in adults. Call your baby's doctor if your child is: Younger than age 3 months and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher. Between ages 3 and 6 months and has a rectal temperature up to 102 F (38.9 C) and seems unusually irritable, lethargic or uncomfortable or has a temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C). Between ages 6 and 24 months and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a cold, cough or diarrhea, you might call your child's doctor sooner based on severity. Children There's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive \u2014 making eye contact with you and responding to your facial expressions and to your voice \u2014 and is drinking fluids and playing. Call your child's doctor if your child: Is listless or irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache or stomachache, or has any other symptoms causing significant discomfort. Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately. Has a fever that lasts longer than three days. Appears listless and has poor eye contact with you. Ask your child's doctor for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a pre-existing illness. Adults Call your doctor if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever: Severe headache Unusual skin rash, especially if the rash rapidly worsens Unusual sensitivity to bright light Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward Mental confusion Persistent vomiting Difficulty breathing or chest pain Abdominal pain or pain when urinating Convulsions or seizures "}, {"illness": "Toxic hepatitis", "img": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/40/ds00097_-ds00373_-ds00398_-ds00399_-ds00411_-ds00455_-ds00676_-ds00743_-ds00785_-ds00811_-ds00961_-ds01125_-ds01133_-my00349_im02250_r7_liverthu_jpg.jpg", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxic-hepatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352202", "symptoms": "Mild forms of toxic hepatitis may not cause any symptoms and may be detected only by blood tests.

They often fluctuate throughout the day, and there may be periods of no symptoms. Symptoms tend to be worse during the night when it's dark and things look less familiar. Primary signs and symptoms include those below. Reduced awareness of the environment This may result in: An inability to stay focused on a topic or to switch topics Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions or conversation Being easily distracted by unimportant things Being withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to the environment Poor thinking skills (cognitive impairment) This may appear as: Poor memory, particularly of recent events Disorientation \u2014 for example, not knowing where you are or who you are Difficulty speaking or recalling words Rambling or nonsense speech Trouble understanding speech Difficulty reading or writing Behavior changes These may include: Seeing things that don't exist (hallucinations) Restlessness, agitation or combative behavior Calling out, moaning or making other sounds Being quiet and withdrawn \u2014 especially in older adults Slowed movement or lethargy Disturbed sleep habits Reversal of night-day sleep-wake cycle Emotional disturbances These may appear as: Anxiety, fear or paranoia Depression Irritability or anger A sense of feeling elated (euphoria) Apathy Rapid and unpredictable mood shifts Personality changes Types of delirium Experts have identified three types of delirium: Hyperactive delirium. Probably the most easily recognized type, this may include restlessness (for example, pacing), agitation, rapid mood changes or hallucinations, and refusal to cooperate with care. Hypoactive delirium. This may include inactivity or reduced motor activity, sluggishness, abnormal drowsiness, or seeming to be in a daze. Mixed delirium. This includes both hyperactive and hypoactive signs and symptoms. The person may quickly switch back and forth from hyperactive to hypoactive states. Delirium and dementia Dementia and delirium may be particularly difficult to distinguish, and a person may have both. In fact, delirium frequently occurs in people with dementia. But having episodes of delirium does not always mean a person has dementia. So a dementia assessment should not be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading. Dementia is the progressive decline of memory and other thinking skills due to the gradual dysfunction and loss of brain cells. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include: Onset. The onset of delirium occurs within a short time, while dementia usually begins with relatively minor symptoms that gradually worsen over time. Attention. The ability to stay focused or maintain attention is significantly impaired with delirium. A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert. Fluctuation. The appearance of delirium symptoms can fluctuate significantly and frequently throughout the day. While people with dementia have better and worse times of day, their memory and thinking skills stay at a fairly constant level during the course of a day. When to see a doctor If a relative, friend or someone in your care shows any signs or symptoms of delirium, see a doctor. Your input about the person's symptoms, typical thinking and everyday abilities will be important for a proper diagnosis and for finding the underlying cause. If you notice signs and symptoms of delirium in a person in a hospital or nursing home, report your concerns to the nursing staff or doctor rather than assuming that those problems have been observed. Older people recovering in the hospital or living in a long-term care facility are particularly at risk of delirium.

For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased. Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face's shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth. Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. Overall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following: Enlarged hands and feet Enlarged facial features, including the facial bones, lips, nose and tongue Coarse, oily, thickened skin Excessive sweating and body odor Small outgrowths of skin tissue (skin tags) Fatigue and joint or muscle weakness Pain and limited joint mobility A deepened, husky voice due to enlarged vocal cords and sinuses Severe snoring due to obstruction of the upper airway Vision problems Headaches, which may be persistent or severe Menstrual cycle irregularities in women Erectile dysfunction in men Loss of interest in sex When to see a doctor If you have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly, contact your doctor for an exam. Acromegaly usually develops slowly. Even your family members may not notice the gradual physical changes that occur with this disorder at first.

How twins are joined Conjoined twins are typically classified according to where they're joined, usually at matching sites, and sometimes at more than one site. They sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies. The specific anatomy of each pair of conjoined twins is unique. Conjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites: Chest. Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins. Abdomen. Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twins share the liver, and some share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and colon. They generally do not share a heart. Base of spine. Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal tract, and a few share the genital and urinary organs. Length of spine. Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. This type is very rare. Pelvis. Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. Many ischiopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs. Trunk. Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the abdomen and chest, but with separate heads. The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs. Head. Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue. Head and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the face and upper body. The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twins rarely survive. In rare cases, twins may be conjoined with one twin smaller and less fully formed than the other (asymmetric conjoined twins). In extremely rare cases, one twin may be found partially developed within the other twin (fetus in fetu).

Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years. Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity \u2014 from low functioning to high functioning. Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence \u2014 they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations. Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function. Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder. Social communication and interaction A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs: Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice Patterns of behavior A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs: Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture As they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. Others, however, continue to have difficulty with language or social skills, and the teen years can bring worse behavioral and emotional problems. When to see a doctor Babies develop at their own pace, and many don't follow exact timelines found in some parenting books. But children with autism spectrum disorder usually show some signs of delayed development before age 2 years. If you're concerned about your child's development or you suspect that your child may have autism spectrum disorder, discuss your concerns with your doctor. The symptoms associated with the disorder can also be linked with other developmental disorders. Signs of autism spectrum disorder often appear early in development when there are obvious delays in language skills and social interactions. Your doctor may recommend developmental tests to identify if your child has delays in cognitive, language and social skills, if your child: Doesn't respond with a smile or happy expression by 6 months Doesn't mimic sounds or facial expressions by 9 months Doesn't babble or coo by 12 months Doesn't gesture \u2014 such as point or wave \u2014 by 14 months Doesn't say single words by 16 months Doesn't play \"make-believe\" or pretend by 18 months Doesn't say two-word phrases by 24 months Loses language skills or social skills at any age "}, {"illness": "Valley fever", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20378761", "symptoms": "Valley fever is the initial form of coccidioidomycosis infection.

Symptoms can range from minor to severe, including: Fever Cough Tiredness Shortness of breath Headache Chills Night sweats Joint aches and muscle soreness Red, spotty rash, mainly on lower legs but sometimes on the chest, arms and back If you don't become ill or have symptoms from valley fever, you may only find out you've been infected later. You may find out when you have a positive skin or blood test or when small areas of residual infection in the lungs (nodules) show up on a routine chest X-ray. The nodules typically don't cause problems, but they can look like cancer on X-rays. If you develop symptoms, especially severe ones, the course of the disease is highly variable. It can take months to fully recover. Fatigue and joint aches can last even longer. The disease's severity depends on several factors, including your overall health and the number of fungus spores you inhale. Chronic coccidioidomycosis If the initial coccidioidomycosis infection doesn't completely resolve, it may progress to a chronic form of pneumonia. This complication is most common in people with weakened immune systems. Signs and symptoms include: Low-grade fever Weight loss Cough Chest pain Blood-tinged sputum (matter discharged during coughing) Nodules in the lungs Disseminated coccidioidomycosis The most serious form of the disease, disseminated coccidioidomycosis, is uncommon. It occurs when the infection spreads (disseminates) beyond the lungs to other parts of the body. Most often these parts include the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord (meninges). Signs and symptoms of disseminated disease depend on the body parts affected and may include: Nodules, ulcers and skin lesions that are more serious than the rash that sometimes occurs with other forms of the disease Painful lesions in the skull, spine or other bones Painful, swollen joints, especially in the knees or ankles Meningitis \u2014 an infection of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord When to see a doctor Seek medical care if you are over 60, have a weakened immune system, are pregnant, or are of Filipino or African heritage, and you develop the signs and symptoms of valley fever, especially if you: Live in or have recently traveled to an area where this disease is common Have symptoms that aren't improving Be sure to tell your doctor if you've traveled to a place where valley fever is common and you have symptoms.

But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma: Inflammation \u2014 follicular. The early infection has five or more follicles \u2014 small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell \u2014 visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva). Inflammation \u2014 intense. In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid. Eyelid scarring. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion). In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea). Corneal clouding (opacity). The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea. All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid. Without intervention, a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood. When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you or your child has itchy or irritated eyes or discharge from the eyes, especially if you live in or recently traveled to an area where trachoma is common. Trachoma is a contagious condition. Treating it as soon as possible helps prevent serious infection.

As the person grows older, he or she typically starts acquiring things for which there is no immediate need or space. By middle age, symptoms are often severe and may be harder to treat. Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. Often, significant clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others. Signs and symptoms may include: Excessively acquiring items that are not needed or for which there's no space Persistent difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of actual value Feeling a need to save these items, and being upset by the thought of discarding them Building up of clutter to the point where rooms become unusable Having a tendency toward indecisiveness, perfectionism, avoidance, procrastination, and problems with planning and organizing Excessive acquiring and refusing to discard items results in: Disorganized piles or stacks of items, such as newspapers, clothes, paperwork, books or sentimental items Possessions that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas and make the space unusable for the intended purpose, such as not being able to cook in the kitchen or use the bathroom to bathe Buildup of food or trash to unusually excessive, unsanitary levels Significant distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself and others safe in your home Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home Difficulty organizing items, sometimes losing important items in the clutter People with hoarding disorder typically save items because: They believe these items are unique or will be needed at some point in the future The items have important emotional significance \u2014 serving as a reminder of happier times or representing beloved people or pets They feel safer when surrounded by the things they save They don't want to waste anything Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, deliberately search out specific items, categorize them and carefully display their collections. Although collections can be large, they aren't usually cluttered and they don't cause the distress and impairments that are part of hoarding disorder. Hoarding animals People who hoard animals may collect dozens or even hundreds of pets. Animals may be confined inside or outside. Because of the large numbers, these animals often aren't cared for properly. The health and safety of the person and the animals are at risk because of unsanitary conditions. When to see a doctor If you or a loved one has symptoms of hoarding disorder, talk with a doctor or mental health professional as soon as possible. Some communities have agencies that help with hoarding problems. Check with the local or county government for resources in your area. As hard as it might be, if your loved one's hoarding disorder threatens health or safety, you may need to contact local authorities, such as police, fire, public health, child or elder protective services, or animal welfare agencies.

This can cause signs and symptoms such as: A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) Wheezing Exercise intolerance Repeated lung infections Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose Recurrent sinusitis Digestive signs and symptoms The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: Foul-smelling, greasy stools Poor weight gain and growth Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) Chronic or severe constipation, which may include frequent straining while trying to pass stool, eventually causing part of the rectum to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse) When to see a doctor If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis \u2014 or if someone in your family has CF \u2014 talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Consult a physician who is knowledgeable about CF. Cystic fibrosis requires consistent, regular follow-up with your doctor, at least every three months. Contact you doctor if you experience new or worsening symptoms, such as more mucus than usual or a change in the mucus color, lack of energy, weight loss, or severe constipation. Seek immediate medical care if you're coughing up blood, have chest pain or difficulty breathing, or have severe stomach pain and distention.

The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood (hypomanic symptoms). The lows consist of mild or moderate depressive symptoms. Cyclothymia symptoms are similar to those of bipolar I or II disorder, but they're less severe. When you have cyclothymia, you can typically function in your daily life, though not always well. The unpredictable nature of your mood shifts may significantly disrupt your life because you never know how you're going to feel. Hypomanic symptoms Signs and symptoms of the highs of cyclothymia may include: An exaggerated feeling of happiness or well-being (euphoria) Extreme optimism Inflated self-esteem Talking more than usual Poor judgment that can result in risky behavior or unwise choices Racing thoughts Irritable or agitated behavior Excessive physical activity Increased drive to perform or achieve goals (sexual, work related or social) Decreased need for sleep Tendency to be easily distracted Inability to concentrate Depressive symptoms Signs and symptoms of the lows of cyclothymia may include: Feeling sad, hopeless or empty Tearfulness Irritability, especially in children and teenagers Loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable Changes in weight Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Sleep problems Restlessness Fatigue or feeling slowed down Problems concentrating Thinking of death or suicide When to see a doctor If you have any symptoms of cyclothymia, seek medical help as soon as possible. Cyclothymia generally doesn't get better on its own. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, work up the courage to confide in someone who can help you take that first step. If a loved one has symptoms of cyclothymia, talk openly and honestly with that person about your concerns. You can't force someone to seek professional help, but you can offer support and help find a qualified doctor or mental health provider. Suicidal thoughts Although suicidal thoughts might occur with cyclothymia, they're more likely to occur if you have bipolar I or II disorder. If you're considering suicide right now: Call 911 or your local emergency services number, or go to a hospital emergency department.

Intrusive memories Symptoms of intrusive memories may include: Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks) Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event Avoidance Symptoms of avoidance may include: Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event Negative changes in thinking and mood Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include: Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world Hopelessness about the future Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event Difficulty maintaining close relationships Feeling detached from family and friends Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed Difficulty experiencing positive emotions Feeling emotionally numb Changes in physical and emotional reactions Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include: Being easily startled or frightened Always being on guard for danger Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast Trouble sleeping Trouble concentrating Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior Overwhelming guilt or shame For children 6 years old and younger, signs and symptoms may also include: Re-enacting the traumatic event or aspects of the traumatic event through play Frightening dreams that may or may not include aspects of the traumatic event Intensity of symptoms PTSD symptoms can vary in intensity over time. You may have more PTSD symptoms when you're stressed in general, or when you come across reminders of what you went through. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your own assault.

However, tinnitus can also cause other types of phantom noises in your ears, including: Buzzing Roaring Clicking Hissing Humming Most people who have tinnitus have subjective tinnitus, or tinnitus that only you can hear. The noises of tinnitus may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears. In some cases, the sound can be so loud it interferes with your ability to concentrate or hear external sound. Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go. In rare cases, tinnitus can occur as a rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound, often in time with your heartbeat. This is called pulsatile tinnitus. If you have pulsatile tinnitus, your doctor may be able to hear your tinnitus when he or she does an examination (objective tinnitus).

It's called tinnitus. Dr. Gayla Poling says tinnitus can be perceived a myriad of ways. \"Ninety percent of those with tinnitus have hearing loss.\" Hearing loss can be age-related, come from a one-time exposure, or exposure to loud sounds over a lifetime. Dr. Poling says the tiny hairs in our inner ear may play a role. \"Those little hair cells in our inner ear are really delicate structures. That's what is actually damaged with noise exposure.\" Dr. Poling says there's no scientifically proven cure for tinnitus, but there are treatment and management options. \"Something as simple as getting a hearing aid to really treat the hearing loss.\" Other options include using a sound generator or using a fan at night. \"There's something called 'tinnitus retraining therapy.'\" There are more ear-level masking devices where you can hear sounds throughout the day, too, that are more distracting.\" If ringing in your ears bothers you, start by seeing your health care provider for a hearing test.

In about half of all brain AVMs, hemorrhage is the first sign. But some people with brain AVM may experience signs and symptoms other than bleeding related to the AVM. In people without hemorrhage, signs and symptoms of a brain AVM may include: Seizures Headache or pain in one area of the head Muscle weakness or numbness in one part of the body Some people may experience more-serious neurological signs and symptoms, depending on the location of the AVM, including: Severe headache Weakness, numbness or paralysis Vision loss Difficulty speaking Confusion or inability to understand others Severe unsteadiness Symptoms may begin at any age but usually emerge between ages 10 and 40. Brain AVMs can damage brain tissue over time. The effects slowly build up and often cause symptoms in early adulthood. Once you reach middle age, however, brain AVMs tend to remain stable and are less likely to cause symptoms. Some pregnant women may have worsened symptoms due to changes in blood volume and blood pressure. One severe type of brain AVM, called a vein of Galen defect, causes signs and symptoms that emerge soon or immediately after birth. The major blood vessel involved in this type of brain AVM can cause fluid to build up in the brain and the head to swell. Signs and symptoms include swollen veins that are visible on the scalp, seizures, failure to thrive and congestive heart failure. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any signs or symptoms of a brain AVM, such as seizures, headaches or other symptoms. A bleeding brain AVM is life-threatening and requires emergency medical attention.
